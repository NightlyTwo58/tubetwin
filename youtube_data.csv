61koDfqjAfQ,Only knowing PHP? 🟥 or 🟩 ?,7393,@syleishere,"Actually it was perl, then PHP, and now Python. At least for anyone that can walk comfortably around FreeBSD, Linux, Cisco systems these days. 

For development it's still mostly python with fastapi now for server end. The client end is where things got really screwed just to make a pretty interface, now you have java, kotlin, swift, flutter, KMP, hell even c++ and unity for games, all this while making your API calls back to your original python lol. 

If someone would make a native python framework to interact directly with JNI etc, developers could spend more time on productive things like AI instead of frameworks :) A red flag would be a language with no native support for FreeBSD, as that's just going to upset way to many CEOs at companies.",0

HvKALwVC9JM,Why does TypeScript let you assign a RobotDog to a variable typed as Dog? Go!,11608,@GoogleDevelopers,"Answer: TypeScript uses structural typing, so if two types have the same shape, assignments between them are allowed, even if one class doesn’t explicitly extend the other. That’s why RobotDog works as a Dog: both have a bark() method. But when Dog includes a private (or protected) field, TypeScript switches to nominal compatibility for those members. In other words, only subclasses that share the same declaration of that private field are considered valid. Since RobotDog doesn’t share Dog’s private state, the assignment fails.",0

HvKALwVC9JM,Why does TypeScript let you assign a RobotDog to a variable typed as Dog?

HvKALwVC9JM,Why does TypeScript let you assign a RobotDog to a variable typed as Dog? Go!,11608,@siddharth_shankar91,"In this scenario it is because of structural typing and compatibility is determined by factors such as shape of the object , its properties, methods etc and not by class name. However addition of private field to eithr of the class make type script shifts to nominal approach which require actual relatedness....fingers crossed🤞 to see if this checks out correct.",0
