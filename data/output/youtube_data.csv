L1QlVr686Bg,What actually prints to the console and why? Go!,5356,@GoogleDevelopers,"Answer: The output is: [1, NaN, NaN]
Here’s why: Array.map passes three arguments to the callback: the current element, the index, and the whole array. parseInt takes two arguments: the string to parse and the radix (number base). When you write [""1"", ""2"", ""3""].map(parseInt), the index gets passed as the radix.
Fix: Use an arrow function so you only pass the string.
const result = [""1"", ""2"", ""3""].map(str => parseInt(str));
or even better, use Number:
const result = [""1"", ""2"", ""3""].map(Number); // [1, 2, 3]",1
L1QlVr686Bg,What actually prints to the console and why? Go!,5356,@GoogleDevelopers,Hint: Remember that Array.map passes more than one argument into the callback. How many parameters does parseInt expect?,3
L1QlVr686Bg,What actually prints to the console and why? Go!,5356,@CodeCecil,"TLDR; [""1"", ""2"", ""3""].map(parseInt) == [""1"", ""2"", ""3""].map((num, idx) => parseInt(num, idx));

The radix provided is the index of the string in the array being iterated over. So ""2"" with a radix of 1 is NaN because 2 is not a valid integer in a base 1 number system. ""1"" is valid because the radix is set to 0 which causes parseInt to chose the best radix based on the string's value. Since there is not leading whitespace, sign or anything else, it is defaulted to base 10 so that is why ""1"" -> 1",3
L1QlVr686Bg,What actually prints to the console and why? Go!,5356,@siddharth_shankar91,This is because when suppose we use .map(parseInt) the parseInt function recieves two arguments for each element first the string to be converted and index of array element to be used as radix parameter in the above. This causes invalid parsing for non decimal bases. Solution may be to use correct way to map strings to numbers.....like .map( Number) etc...,0

I don't exactly fit the demographic of a ""typical"" gamer (I am a 55 year-old woman). Why did I start at the age of 53? I had a cancer scare. During my journey of tests, bioassays, and more tests, Link (TotK) was the only one who was able to keep me away from the stress vortex. I tried reading (my usual go-to) but inevitably, my brain would wander and I would be in that stress vortex again. Gaming forced my brain to keep engaged at the task at hand. Thankfully, my kids had the Switch and that was how I was able to play TotK.

As it turned out, it was just a ""scare"" and not cancer itself. I am still playing games. I'm doing BotW now and I don't understand why so many people prefer this game over TotK. Maybe I am a ""strategist."" In TotK, I was able to build whatever contraption to aid me in whatever situation. In BotW, I feel like I have to brute force my way through a lot of situations. And because I suck at combat, Link dies a lot more in this game. 😅 He always needs a pocketful of fairies.

Anyway, I don't know that I've played enough games to be able to label myself as a certain ""type"" of gamer. Or if I can even label myself as a ""gamer."" BotW is my 4th game. I am the most casual of casual gamers.",944

The ghost lady is queen Yharnam, due to weird circumstances she gets impregnated by a greater being (Eldritch god), however every greater being is destined to lose its child and yearns for a surrogate.

The queen eventually loses the baby and dies, don’t remember the details at the moment but it wasn’t a pleasant affair. The school of Mensis, one of the main groups in the lore seeking a way to ascend does a ritual to create the Nightmare of Mensis (a plane of existence on top of the one you spend most of your time on). They do this to keep the child kind of alive enough to attract Greater Beings from whom they can learn more Eldritch knowledge.

When you slay the Wet Nurse, Mergo (the child) is finally able to fully die which finally lets the queen’s spirit to rest in peace. The whole game is themed around Birth and Rebirth, there is a bunch of different groups trying to ascend into greater beings and in one of the endings the player character is the first mortal to succeed in this endeavor (the third umbilical cord items are the key).",501

Pam and Jim were never meant to be perfect. One of their “jobs” is to observe and react to the craziness of the other characters. They, especially Jim, sort of talk to us, like “You saw this madness too, right?” 

The show was made to be a documentary, where the employees are filmed, and as Kevin said in the end, “If you get filmed long enough, you’re gonna do something stupid.” If Pam and Jim were perfect, what fun would that be? What lesson would they take from it? None. 

Look at their final messages, the one from Pam about growing up, facing her fears, and how she was angry at herself. And even Jim’s, seeing himself become a father, seeing himself make mistakes and grow. 

You guys are mad at Jim and Pam because you think they were meant to be perfect, when no one is, and that is the point. Especially Pam, who does not have an over-the-top personality, whose flaws are not meant to make you laugh like the others’ are.",111

Called: Playing Hide and seek in TSB
Map: Anything

Idea:
1) Use the morph emote to transform into anything
(But not the tree)

2) Hide anywhere in the map

3) The seeker will play as Genos
(Can only use Blitz Shot)

4) the seeker only get 10 shots (see what I did there?) or 2/3 mins

5) First to 5 wins is the winner

6) Hiding time 1 mins

Additionals :
 7) the winner of the previous round gets to decide the next map

8) make a tornament for all your subscriber with this idea with a reward

And if you use this idea can you credit me? You can make some changes if you want but that's all byeeeee.",1

Preheat oven to 350 F
Line muffin pan with muffin inserts

DRY INGREDIENTS
2 1/2 cups almond flour
2 T coconut flour
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/4 teaspoons of salt
Whisk well! Set aside!

WET INGREDIENTS
3 large eggs room temperature 
1/3 cup Maple Syrup
1/4 cup melted EV coconut
1 teaspoons vanilla
1 Teaspoon apple cider vinegar 

Blend wet ingredients until creamy.  

Pour wet into the dry mixture folding …do not over mix.

ADD 1 cup of FROZEN blueberries…I used wild. 

Fill muffin cups 3/4 of the way…Bake for 22-25 minutes.
Add a sprinkle of cinnamon if you like.

Coconut Chia Seed Pudding
1/3 cup Maple syrup ( or Honey)
1 small bag of frozen fruit
2 cups of coconut milk ( I use So Delicious unsweetened )
1 scoop of protein powder ( I used Orgain )
2 teaspoons of vanilla
1 1/4 cup of Chia seeds

In a blender add Maple syrup, bag of fruit, coconut milk , protein powder and vanilla…blend well.
Pour over chia seeds in large bowl….whisk until fully incorporated…cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours…I like overnight

Chocolate Seed Bark
(preheat oven to 325 F) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper 
1/2 cup of  (UNSALTED) each |  pumpkin seeds, slivered almonds, chopped pistachios, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds ( or any seed/nut blend you like ) and a 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut chips or shredded 
1/4 cup of maple syrup 
2 Tablespoons coconut oil ( melted)
2 Tablespoons of Tahini

Mix together in a bowl until well incorporated.  
Spread mixture on the lined baking sheet using a spatula to flatten mixture to a thin layer…( the thinner the crispier) press it all together leaving no gaps in the seed layer . 

Bake for 15-25 minutes ( this depends on your oven, and the thickness or thinness of your seed layer …..you want it golden on the top and the edges ) Keep watch at the 15 minute mark, you do not want to burn it.

For the chocolate top layer:
Melt 1 cup of sugar free chocolate chips with 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil 
You want to be able to pour on top of your seeds layer and spread easily

When seed layer is finished baking…remove and pour chocolate layer over the top..spreading to cover the top completely…TOP with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt …(if you use salted seeds and nuts…OMIT SALT)

Allow the crunch seed layer to cool down…then place in the refrigerator to cool completely ( about 15 minutes is good)

Break into pieces. Store in the refrigerator (ENJOY)",17

実は私ごとなのですが、相当前に1度、このチャンネルでリクエストをさせて頂きました。その頃は確かまだ中学生で、家庭環境やストレスによって不登校になっていた頃です。夜眠りに付けず、色んな精神安定音楽（？）のようなものを探し回っていた時に辿り着いたチャンネルがこのチャンネルでした。その時に聞いたのはディズニーメドレー。その中に入っているホールニューワールドのループ再生されたものが聞きたくて、ダメ元&興味本位でリクエストをコメント欄に書きました。その時の私は、こんなにチャンネル登録者も多く、コメントも大量にあって見つけて貰えないだろうし、独り言かのように、あったらいいなー感覚でコメントしたつもりが、本当に動画投稿をしてくださっていたことを今気づきました。本当にありがとうございます。このチャンネルを見てなかったわけじゃなく、ずっと高評価した動画を見るを繰り返していて、新着動画には目を通していなかったのです。今このことに気づき、自然と何故だか涙が溢れました。笑
どこの誰かも分からない一人の人間のことを応援してくれる人。こうやって人を喜ばせるためにリクエストに答えてくれる人がいるんだって今、ものすごく感動しています。この思いを忘れずに、ちゃんとこの残酷な世界を生き抜いてやろうと思います。ありがとう。
もしかしたらたまたまホールニューワールドのループ再生の動画が上がっただけっていう勘違いだったらお恥ずかしいです💦笑それでもでもでも！このチャンネルに助けられたことは間違いないです。本当に感謝しています。",28

You have reached a point where the pressure differential between the top of the chimney and the narrowing is greater than the force of the gasses coming from the fire below.  This creates suction of fresh air, but then that air is cooler lowering the chimney pressure.  At which point the pressure of gasses coming from the fire below is now higher than in the chimney.  This back and forth cycle is the pulse.  This opening is essentially acting similar to the valve in a conventional pulse jet.

You could in theory tune this by changing size and placement of the door.  Or by changing the height of the chimney. 

Change this in one direction and you’ll get a steady stream of air with the door open.  Change it the other way and you’ll start to get to the point where combustion at the bottom will slow and combustible gasses will build leading to high force detonations happening.  The latter would in theory produce thrust but in this case would likely cause the lower chamber to explode and collapse in on itself.

Although these pulses could be useful in some situations, they would cap the temperature of your smelt.",429

By simply having it be taller, but keeping the charging cycle similair, you'll cause a lot more air to get sucked into the furnace as the hot air shoots up the chimeny and causes suction. Makes the whole thing more efficient. There's a reason every smelter I've ever seen work well is fairly tall. usually chest high or a bit shorter. If the flames are sitting on the edge like that, it's not tall enough. This will also keep more of the heat in place to melt the iron. 
You may also want to explore near your iron sludge for iron bearing rocks to get easier ore. That bacteria is getting the iron from somewhere and importantly swims towards iron. Follow the sludge, you'll find iron.",3087

Χρησιμοποιώ την100%L- ascorbic acid powder  της δε ορντιναρι , εδώ κ δύο χρόνια..
Είμαι ευχαριστημένη.. αλλά την βαρέθηκα..
Το  σερουμ με την βιταμίνη c  που μας δείχνεις έχει καθαρή βιταμίνη ή παράγωγο  της;
Στο βίντεο λες ότι είναι καθαρή  βιταμίνη , αλλά εγώ σε ρωτώ για να το επιβεβαιώσω..
Στα συστατικά βρήκα sodium k ascorbic acid  δηλαδή παράγωγο κ καθαρή  βιταμίνη;
Έχω σημειώσει πως να ξεχωρίζω τα συστατικά από σένα..σημείωσα όσα μας είπες...

Πρέπει να σου πω ένα μεγάλο ευχαριστώ που με έβαλες σε αυτόν τον όμορφο κόσμο των καλλυντικών και της περιποίησης του προσώπου!!
Είμαι 60 χρονών και μέχρι τώρα χρησιμοποιούσα σπάνια κρέμες (το καλοκαίρι σχεδόν καθόλου και το χειμώνα μόνο αν με «τραβούσε» το δέρμα μου) και αυτό γιατί είμαι ας πούμε καλή κράση και δεν ένιωθα ότι το έχω ανάγκη μιας που πάντα έδειχνα και δείχνω πιο μικρή καμία 10ετια, άρα για εμένα ήταν χαμένος χρόνος και vanity το να ασχοληθώ με τον εαυτό μου… 
Έχω δει τα περισσότερα βιντεακια σου (και όχι μόνο μια φορά το καθένα χαχα!!) και ΝΑΙ με ΕΠΕΙΣΕΣ να ασχοληθώ με ΕΜΕΝΑ και την επιδερμίδα μου. Είσαι τόσο αναλυτική και την ίδια στιγμή περιεκτική που με έπεισες να φτιάξω μια ρουτίνα πρωινή και μια βραδινή. Αγόρασα  toner, essence, ampoule (άγνωστες λέξεις μέχρι στιγμής για εμένα) και αντιηλιακή προσώπου!! Βασικά από όλα αυτά τα προϊόντα που μας έχεις δείξει εκανα μια δική μου επιλογή με βάση τις δικές μου ανάγκες και εδώ και μια εβδομάδα ακολουθώ κατά γράμμα το τελετουργικό της περιποίησης ( στραβομουτσουνιάζοντας τις πρώτες μέρες γιατί θεωρούσα αυτό το τεταρτακι που μου έπαιρνε η όλη ρουτίνα χάσιμο χρόνου)….αλλά το έκανα!!.. και ….να σου την τρίτη μέρα το πρωί που όπως έριχνα νερό στο πρόσωπο μου για να ξυπνήσω κοιτάζομαι στον καθρέφτη και είδα διαφορά στο δέρμα μου!! Ήταν πιο φωτεινο!! Πιο λείο!!! Πιο σφριγηλό !! Άγγιξα με το χέρι μου το κόκκαλο που είναι κάτω από τα μάτια και πια δεν ένιωθα ένα πετσί με ένα κόκαλο από κάτω!! Είχε γεμίσει το δέρμα μου και ήταν και απαλό!! Τα μάτια μου δεν είχαν αυτούς τους συνηθισμένους μαύρους κύκλους από κάτω και το δέρμα δεν ήταν πια τόσο διάφανο ώστε να φαίνονται τα αγγεία!! ΤΡΕΛΑΘΗΚΑ!! ΜΕΣΑ ΣΕ 3 ΗΜΕΡΕΣ!!
Και ακριβώς αυτό θα ήθελα να πω και να μοιραστώ με εσένα Δήμητρα και όλες τις φίλες που σε ακολουθούν, ότι αυτό το μισάωρο την ημέρα, σου αποδίδει τόσα πολλά!! Το λέει μια δύσπιστη που ενώ αγόραζα κρέμες ποτέ δεν τις έβαζα (πέταξα χτες ακριβές κρέμες ανέγγιχτες που είχαν λήξει!!)
Καλή συνέχεια σε όλες!!",0

Also saw ur linkedIn, u work in consulting which is great! 

I almost follow same strategy saving 50% of my after tax income, but as a 23yo immigrant, not in corporate field, I could only save £1k/month, could you please tell me a platform I could maximise my savings for a 10months - 12months.

A viewer rightly pointed out that rebalancing inside a GIA (General Investment Account) can have tax implications and create extra admin because of the sell/buy orders. If your gains from those sales go over the annual CGT allowance (£3,000 in 2025/26), you’ll need to report it on your self-assessment and pay Capital Gains Tax on the excess.

👉 In my video I was referring specifically to rebalancing inside my ISA, where you don’t need to worry about those tax implications. To be clear, I personally avoid using the rebalance button often — usually only once a year if allocations drift significantly.

So if you’re using a GIA, just be mindful that rebalancing has extra tax admin attached. As always, please do you own research.",1

This is OK inside an ISA but in a GIA it can cause a problem because you will have to work out the capital gains for your self-assessment tax form each year if it is over 3k of gains. You may have 50+ sell transactions in a tax year and you have to take into account the same day rule, 30-day rule and section 104 rule. Also, these rules apply across ALL your GIA accounts if you have GIAs with other brokers.  e.g. selling 10k SWDA on IE GIA and then buying 2k SWDA on Trading 212 on GIA Invest account within 30 days due to clicking 'rebalance' would mean the 30-day rule would apply. Because of this, I don't use Pies in GIAs.",1

Anyone that just got in and borrowed the last possible dollar they could get probably shouldn’t have. It’s the same as  spending all your pocket money on lollies and not leaving enough money for the bus home and then blaming your decision to squeeze things too tight on someone else. It’s just unfortunate that people are learning this lesson on a house instead of something small like lollies.

It would be good to have a balance as the rate of increases are pretty fast for many to keep up. I know for me personally, I went on Maternity Leave in March and I had everything budgeted. The mortgage alone is now costing $700 a month more now than back in March for us. Plus all other expenses going up whilst we have a lot less coming in. We have eaten into our savings just to keep up and give me more time with my last bubs. The timing is terrible and I need to go back to work early just to keep up. So many people in different situations, but it has been good to see the interest increase on my children's savings accounts too. Pros and cons to everything.",1

I’m looking forward to more videos on each topic—they are easy to understand and enjoyable. I have a doubt. In the previous syllabus, for Paper 1 ERQ, students would prepare for the approach they were interested in, such as Biological, with only two studies, while for the rest—i.e., Sociocultural and Cognitive—they would prepare only one study for the sake of SAQs. Similarly, for Paper 2, SL students could choose Human Relationships and focus only on the Social Responsibility topic for the exam. In the new syllabus, are there any choices for students to select specific topics like in the previous syllabus, making it easier to study? Please guide me. Thank you so much.",1

I'm sure the reason there is no solo in RedSec is because Battlefield is a TEAM game. It has always been about players working together not everyone playing against each other. A solo mode would only enforce that single minded selfish gameplay.

As for the achievements are primarily focused around RedSec for the battle pass. Do you think this might have something to do with promoting the entirely new format? And encourage players to experience BR? This is a 12 week season. So the possibility of weekly achievements will be more even for the battle pass in weeks to come.",0

Sure they share similar electronic mediums but the participation requirement for gaming is closer to that of a sport. Watch a video of any length is like a fan of a sport in the bleachers. Playing a video game is like a player on the field of that sport. A player doesn’t just leave the field to get food whenever they want like a fan can because active engagement doesn’t allow for that, if you want to be proficient or at least effective. This mindset Microsoft has is fundamentally flawed.",14

I did my research and I found out that only a Magistrate’s Court, known as a civilian court, can issue a less serious charge for a sexual assault offence, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 6 months in prison. The ex-sergeant, the perpetrator who committed the sexual assault offence on the lady, named Jaysley Beck, may she rest in peace, was tried in a MILITARY COURT, to put that into plain English, that is the equivalent to the powers of a Crown Court, which deals with serious offences, which carries ‘a range of community order to 7 years’ custody, with a maximum of 10 years’. I agree with the people saying that ‘he should get life’, the details of this case are horrific to justify such sentiment.

Sky News is right, Jaysley Beck was indeed ‘failed by the system that was meant to protect her’.",3
