I tried reading (my usual go-to) but inevitably, my brain would wander and I would be in that stress vortex again. Gaming forced my brain to keep engaged at the task at hand. Thankfully, my kids had the Switch and that was how I was able to play TotK.

As it turned out, it was just a ""scare"" and not cancer itself. I am still playing games. I'm doing BotW now and I don't understand why so many people prefer this game over TotK. Maybe I am a ""strategist."" In TotK, I was able to build whatever contraption to aid me in whatever situation. In BotW, I feel like I have to brute force my way through a lot of situations.

The ghost lady is queen Yharnam, due to weird circumstances she gets impregnated by a greater being (Eldritch god), however every greater being is destined to lose its child and yearns for a surrogate.

The queen eventually loses the baby and dies, don’t remember the details at the moment but it wasn’t a pleasant affair. The school of Mensis, one of the main groups in the lore seeking a way to ascend does a ritual to create the Nightmare of Mensis (a plane of existence on top of the one you spend most of your time on). They do this to keep the child kind of alive enough to attract Greater Beings from whom they can learn more Eldritch knowledge.

When you slay the Wet Nurse, Mergo (the child) is finally able to fully die which finally lets the queen’s spirit to rest in peace. The whole game is themed around Birth and Rebirth, there is a bunch of different groups trying to ascend into greater beings and in one of the endings the player character is the first mortal to succeed in this endeavor (the third umbilical cord items are the key).",501

When faced with the decision at the end of the game, I thought I made the right choice, I chose Maelle's ending and was HORRIFIED by it. This set off a chain reaction in my brain. I came to the conclusion that I always chose escapism. Whether through art, distraction or in my most prevalent case, smoking weed. I came to the conclusion that I never actually mourned my dad, I just kept smoking weed, feeling alright and pretending everything was fine. But I think I always knew that it wasn't.

Maybe You are just a village boy, doing errands for you uncle or grandparents, taking small quests to deliver supplies to your neighbours or whatever. And eventually, the stakes get higher. Maybe you discover some sort prophecy of ruin, or some instigating event forces you to take the role of hero to fight unsurmountable opposition to save the world, usually climaxing with you defeating some sort of godly being. Clair Obscur does the exact opposite. You start already with the huge threat quite literally looming over the horizon.

Lohse is a bard that has been possessed by a demon, and during your travels, you try to help her during some sidequests and realize that little by little, Lohse is going to be squeezed out of her own life, permanently taken over by the demon. Worse, the demon will own her soul itself, which fuels its own power, until it moves on to the next mark. In act 3 of the game, you finally learn who the demon is and how to access its domain.

In that domain, you find no enemies, but in the twisted caverns of this region, you do find a candle. And you realize that this candle represents a soul. A soul that is possessed by the demon, is supplying it with power. You have two options -- to leave the candle be, or to snuff it out, effectively exterminating that person from existence, but weakening the demon ever so slightly. So you snuff it out and deem it an act of mercy.

A short way down the path, you find a second candle. You look into the flame and see the person who once was. What their life represented, who the people they touched were. This person who *you* will effectively be eliminating. But knowing what is at stake, and to prevent future victims, you snuff the candle.

You continue down the path to a third candle. And then a fourth. And when approaching what appears to be a fifth and final candle, you realize that its location looks out over a cliff. As you approach this candle, the camera shifts to give you the view over the cliff, and....there is an open cavern below that is nothing but a sea of candles. Hundreds. Thousands. An uncountable number of them. THIS is the monster that you contend with. And this is, arguably, the monster you have to be in snuffing them out.",2370

I'm not really that good with shooters, so I was playing the game slowly, taking cover often, and making sure I killed the enemys one by one. But then I arrived at the Ashtray Maze and everything changed. The Maze doesn't give you any power-up, it doesn't weaken the enemys or anything like that, but with that music and level design, it was empowering ME as a player. I didn't realize at first, but near the end it hit me. I played the maze as a maniac, flying through the level and killing enemies like I was born for this. It was like a beautiful dance where I felt invincible, and the enemies where just like little stones in the road before I passed through them.

I will never forget the Ashtray Maze. Definitely one of the best videogame levels I've ever played, and a great example of the sensations and emotions that only games can give you.",956

The couple are the first people who have not turned the two disguised gods away. They offer Hermes and Zeus a place to stay, as well as hospitality--by which, I mean they offer their guests the best things that they have, meager though they might be. They sacrifice for the betterment of these strangers.

In the morning, Zeus and Hermes reveal the truth of who they are to the couple, and ask how they can reward them for the great kindness they have shown. The couple's lives renewed to their former youth, and their home is turned into a temple with a beautiful garden of fruit trees. Most importantly, they are gifted with a promise that when their time to pass on comes, they will not be separated, but will rather pass on together. And with regard to this, the gods keep their word. 

I'm not sure if I ended up blending two myths together, but growing up I always brought a small gift to the home of anyone I was staying with as a guest due to the myth I just shared. As a thank you for those people who were letting me stay in their home.

Walls appear behind you, you often question the layout of the floors because video games aren’t constrained to physical reality.

We have spoken to so many people who have fallen into TV Tropes rabbit holes to the point where they can't watch a single piece of media without popping every single TV Tropes flash card out of their pockets when they recognize it, and worse yet is that they falsely believe that just _using_ a trope is a sign of bad writing. We know better than to use TV Tropes as a substitute for media literacy, but it hit me the most when a friend was telling me that they were watching _Everything Everywhere All At Once_ with their mother, and during the third act of that film the mother completely tuned out once she locked in on the idea of ""Oh, this is just an overly-positive 'love wins' scenario"". And this is a sentiment I have also heard several times with good stories that I cherish that people simply write off as having a ""power of friendship"" narrative that somehow robs it of depth or meaning. 

I don't know if I ever cured myself of media cynicism; I still roll my eyes at the latest servings from Marvel because my brain can't help recognizing the pattern of Marvel's multi-tiered meganarrative. But at the very least I've been exposed to the worst kind of media nihilism that I can tell myself confidently that ""I don't want to be _that_ person"".

I don't think that the ""analyzing brain"" is ruining our immersion or that it's actually that detrimental. It's the feeling of obligation to something other than your own personal goals. People aren't engaging, analyzing, or ""thinking deeply"" about media because they genuinely want to. They're doing it because that's what everyone on Twitter is telling them that's what they're supposed to do. If you genuinely love the piece of art/media, and you're choosing to analyze it for yourself than it is no longer ""ruining"" anything. Analyzing the structure or ""taking yourself out"" of the work isn't a bad thing if you're doing it out of an inherent curiosity or love for the medium, but because everyone is telling you this is what you're supposed to do you end up doing it almost out of a cultural pressure, and that's what I think is taking away the enjoyment. 

This also affects how we choose to analyze work as well, what ""takes"" we're supposed to have (and you better have the correct one or else everyone will be mad at you!). We force ourselves to think in specific ways so that we can regurgitate some kind of opinion to the outside world when really any type of analyzing should be for your own personal growth and for improving whatever relationship you have with the media you care so much about. Ultimately you can and SHOULD think deeply and analyze media, but you should be doing it because you're genuinely naturally curious about it, not because everyone else is doing it or they told you you have to. Find the specific pieces of art/media that speak to you, and make you naturally curious, and then it won't be so detrimental.",49

It's the most influential turning-point to any fan of any art form; the moment you've consumed many games and begin to feel a feeling that there's a game that's missing (but doesn't exist, yet), or you begin to see the flaws of your favorite games and begin to wonder or think of ways it can be fixed or improved, you've just begun the privilege of hearing the artist's calling for the first time.

Those who follow the artist's calling begin the amazing journey of creation, transitioning from a consumer to a producer, fueled by the passion of giving back to their communities or the game genres they love. That calling is the reason why people get inspired to create their dream games, which could inspire others after them to create their dream games, and the beautiful cycle of creation repeats on and on.

I've been thinking of getting into gamedev myself someday, inspired by games and wanting to tell stories myself. For example, a game that really inspires me would be the Kingdom Hearts series , but I don't need to tell you how jarringly flawed it's convoluted plot can be; despite that, due to how much the games get right, I can't help but think if there was a game that captures the magic of Kingdom Hearts but nails the story. While I'm unable to make a game with a scope anywhere near that of Kingdom Hearts anytime soon, the inspiration of creation that I get from playing them gives me hope that I may make something amazing like it someday in the future.

Regardless, I think the option of moving from a consumer of games to a producer is a powerful option and shouldn't be undemrined, giving back to the games/genres you love through inspiration and passion, possibly inspiring others to create their dream games in the process too.",140

You can beat Outer Wilds in the first loop if you know how, and if you were wiser, you could prove things in math that I currently can't.

I always had a lot of trouble explaining why anime resonated with me in a different way than western TV and film, but this video explained a lot. 

I started watching anime during the pandemic, a time when I felt at my most isolated and was really disillusioned with individualism because of the selfish way so many of my neighbors and even family were acting. The nihilistic, ""you're on your own"" attitude of most western media (especially social media) really weighed down on me. 

So I too, I found a lot of solace in seeing the interconnected nature of anime and Japanese culture. The sense of community between the characters as they strive for their goals together, the way they lean on each other both consciously and unconsciously, and especially the way they confront their fears and anxieties head-on, all fill me with happiness and make me feel a lot better about my own place in the world.

This hits too close to home. It's the worst feeling when you finally beat a boss and you don't even feel a sense of pride or accomplishment. You're just grateful you don't have to lose anymore. I've been a sore loser since I was little, and despite improving with time; I still very much cannot stand losing.

It's amazing how much a preventative mindset can shut you down mentally. If you can't win, then the only winning move is not to play. I tend to avoid playing competitive games against human players because you're essentially guaranteed to lose at least some of the time and I can't cope with it. It's even worse for team games, the responsibility to succeed for the sake of your team feels like a crushing burden to carry. Competitive games are pretty much off limits for me to play because they're just too stressful.

It's even worse when it affects other parts of your life. You stop working on projects because you failed, and now you're too afraid to try. You know that if you try you'll fail, so the only way to avoid failure is not to try. You try to tell yourself that failure is okay and a necessity, but you can't shake the self-imposed responsibility to succeed.

It's a very toxic mindset and difficult to overcome. How do you learn to be okay with failing? How do you absolve yourself of the responsibility to succeed? I don't know the answer to either of these questions.

What I do know is that I understand myself just a little bit better because of this video. Thank you Daryl.",2038

My whole gaming ""life"", in every single game that I could go that direction, I farmed my ass off after a couple of losses. I scoped the power of my opponent and made sure I'm much stronger before facing them again. My friends keep wondering how I enjoy the game when I farm for 4-5 hours and then smash the boss' face to the ground with almost no effort. How I get my sense of accomplishment. I just say ""I made sure I wouldn't lose and that was more than enough"".

In team games, I will pick the healer and the tank to stay alive and keep others alive as well. I will fill my bags with items to drop on my teammates when they need them etc. My teammates make sure we'll win and I make sure we won't lose.

That was fine and all, until I dug a bit deeper into my psyche. I became a veterinarian to not ""lose"" to diseases etc (yeah, it's a bit more complex than that but that's the emotional core for me) and prevent others from losing as well. My whole lifestyle is the prevention of something bad. In gaming it's manageable ""Big bad guy needs to eat dirt, I'm a dirt server, badabim badaboom"". But in real life it's really taxing sometimes. You can't always save the dog, you can't mend the relationship, you can't ""farm"" before facing a problem, you can't make sure you won't lose. And quitting is irreversible. (Please stay healthy, people, both physically and mentally!)

One particular episode of that show documented the 1998 Denver Broncos, and one of the people interviewed was Mark Schlereth, who was an offensive lineman for the team.  The Broncos had won the Super Bowl the previous year, in which they had been massive underdogs against the Packers.  But this season (98), they were heavy favorites against the Falcons.

Schlereth said, after beating the Falcons, the atmosphere around the team was completely different than the year before.  Whereas in 97, it was all jubilation after winning the SB as underdogs, in 98 it was relief.  No joy, just relief.  They had won the game they were ""supposed"" to win, and anything less would have been humiliating.

I got into it during college because I was depressed and isolated, and I craved the comfortable nostalgia that came with Pokémon. I’ve hunted more than a hundred shinies in various games, Gen 5 - Gen 8, with all the various methods (Masuda hatching, SOS chaining, horde encounters, straight random encounters, etc.). The easy, repetitive grind was very soothing and helped when my depression and anxiety got the best of me. I found a shiny hunting streamer that I liked, and I became very active in their chat for a good two years. The sense of community and belonging that came with that helped me feel not alone.

Eventually though, college ended, I had a real job now, and I was still depressed. I started making difficult lifestyle decisions to improve my mental health (eating healthier, starting an exercise regimen, seeing a therapist, getting better sleep). My time became a lot more precious. At the start of this process, I still shiny hunted regularly. Slowly, I began to realize that my favorite pastime had become a crutch. I prioritized shiny hunting over exercise or hanging out with my IRL friends. Every successful hunt brought a momentary high followed swiftly by the desire to start the next hunt. Like you said in the video, I began to have these “Come to Jesus” moments where I realized that no, I didn’t want to spend my time in this way anymore.

I think shiny hunting can be a fun, soothing way to pass time, especially if you struggle with anxiety/depression. But if you’re like me, the addictive nature of it can make it difficult to move forward. If anyone reading this is thinking about shiny hunting, I would at the very least find people to do it with, whether that’s IRL friends, your discord buds, or a streamers chat. Hell, start streaming it yourself and build your own community. Just don’t let shiny hunting become the only thing you do. There are over 1000 Pokémon now. You will never run out of things to hunt.

The time before a boss in a roguelike can be just as important if not more important than the boss itself. In Hades I finally managed to defeat the titular boss himself not because I mastered his patterns, but because I mastered everything before him. I had enough skill to play the early game well, get lots of resources, and pick the right boons for a powerful build.

On the opposite side of the spectrum is Dark Souls elevators. All they do is make the player wait. It's essentially just a loading screen; there's no gameplay to be had. It's just Ornstein and Smough putting you in the timeout chair for being bad at the game. The rest of the run back to the boss is fine; it's a test of how many resources you can save for the boss fight. Mastering the area before the boss can mean the difference between going into the fight with 10 flasks and going into the fight with a quarter health and zero flasks. If you're a mage, how many spell slots/FP can you save for the boss? 

The Celeste example you mentioned is a great example of why gaps can be good. I experienced the same issue where I just got worse and worse each attempt until I finally gave up. Without anything to break up the space between attempts you just keep getting more and more tense and never take a breath.

Maybe in the end this is just a question of pacing in a game. Too much of the same type of gameplay for a long stretch of time can be bad regardless of its intentions. Ideally we want to give the player some control over the pacing; let them put their nose to the grindstone if they want. If they're having fun trying to learn the boss why punish them? If they need a break give them some alternative activities to do; let them go shopping, do a sidequest, take in a scenic view, or listen to some of the game's music.

Gaps are just another tool in the game designer's toolbox. It's up to the designer to decide when and where they're needed. 
In the end it's just one more thing to improve a game, or one more thing to mess it up.",422

I'm reminded of this documentary about the search for missing children (I don't recall the name but the subject matter is fairly common so it shouldn't be the only one), how parents would never give up, and would beg that if anyone knows anything, no matter how little, no matter if it is bad news, to please tell them, they need the closure of knowing the truth.

The part that will forever stay with me was, months later, when they interviewed again a lone mother after she'd learned the worst possible news, is that she told them that she wishes she'd stayed ignorant and could continue the search, she wished that she could continue to have hope, instead of getting that closure.

What that parent wanted wasn't the truth regardless of whether it was good or bad for them, they wanted the truth but only if it was good. Otherwise they'd rather believe a lie.

To bring this back to Omori and the study, I think that people aren't so much curious about what noise could be under the mystery boxes or what horrible secret may hide behind the doors, but rather they're hoping that it'll be a pleasant surprise. Maybe they'll find a box that says ""you win $10"" or maybe one of the doors has a character who explains the whole plot to you or something like that.

I don't have much to base this on, but I figure part of what makes the Pandora Effect result in misery is that participants often face the disappointing reality of a truth they already knew in the first place but hoped wasn't real. It gives them false hope and makes them feel dumb for daring to believe in it.

Some of you guys have been asking about the prices of the treatments that I got, which I didn't get around to including in the video so I'll leave the prices below. 

Standard Consultation (20-45 minutes): $50/$100
Acupuncture (30-45 minutes): $128
Moxa (30 minutes): $58
Cupping (15 minutes): $48
Cosmetic acupuncture (100 minutes: includes facial cleansing, facial acupressure & massage, acupuncture & mask): $500
Customized herbal tonics (lasting 1 month): $98~$268 (depending on formula)

Each clinic will have different prices, packages & facilities (as well as overall ""vibes"", this location was by the far the most legit and calming atmospherically that I've been to), but this is just to give you ballpark figures in Manhattan, New York ✌

They have 2 locations in Manhattan with slightly different prices: midtown west & midtown east.

My mom taught me early  on never to buy anything less than 18K gold. As an adult, I did not heed her advice and tried gold vermeil, and it tarnished within weeks.  Now, I'm slowly building my jewelry collection, only buying real gold from local jewelers. I make exception for jewelries with precious stones like diamonds, sapphires, because they are usually set in 14k gold, any higher would be too soft to hold the setting securely.",4

Idk if it’s a good thing or bad thing growing up that way but it’s a little sad looking back at something I wanted as a kid and knowing we didn’t have money for it.

Cosme Decorte is so popular in Japan, so many of my Japanese friends use that powder and also their serum, which I see on most Japanese beauty youtubers recs. I quite like both Curel and iHada products as they are good for dry sensitive skin, I mostly use their face creams though. I remember the Shu Uemura cleansing oils being a big hit like 15 years ago or something when I was a kid anyway even in the West, I didn't think they were still a thing. Jill Stuart do really cute packaging, as does another brand called Anna Sui that is very popular in Japan for makeup.",6

I used to only use Korean skincare but started to lean towards the Japanese ones because I think they're more consistent, meaning that I will be able to find the product I love to use. Like you said, the Japanese seem to stick to their favourite products for life.

With these procedures, beauty is often standardized, as everyone tends to look eerily attractive in the same way. A friend of mine began with a nose job, followed by dental work, lip enhancement, and breast augmentation. Now, she’s considering a buttock procedure. During one of our get together, she confessed feeling emptier and lonelier with each transformation. Despite these emotions, she felt powerless to stop seeking further surgeries. “It’s become my addiction,” she said. I think that this is not just a matter of physical appearance but a deep, inner conflict. Is it a mental or emotional struggle; or is it spiritual? The pursuit of external perfection often leads to an internal void, where one’s true sense of self gets lost beneath layers of cosmetic alterations. Is there any amount of surgery that can fix what is broken within the spirit? We know that true self-worth and happiness are built from within, not from the outside. In the end, the emptiness is not due to an imperfect body, but to the disconnect between who we are and who we are trying to become. Do we, humans, want so many things to the point of being greedy? 

Can we truly find peace with ourselves when we are constantly chasing an ideal that leaves us feeling more disconnected from our authentic selves?",5

My son loves watching your videos and I really felt it was important for me to let you know what an impact you have and how much we appreciate you expressing your faith and making safe content. 
It is difficult for young people in today’s world to find channels like yours that are shedding light instead of darkness. Our son enjoys watching YouTube but I’ve almost had to remove it because there is too much unsafe content he was finding. But he loves playing games and watching your videos. What a relief to us that he found your channel and that you believe in Jesus. My husband and I want to say thank you! and encourage you to keep it up! It’s making a difference",1

Pam and Jim were never meant to be perfect. One of their “jobs” is to observe and react to the craziness of the other characters. They, especially Jim, sort of talk to us, like “You saw this madness too, right?” 

The show was made to be a documentary, where the employees are filmed, and as Kevin said in the end, “If you get filmed long enough, you’re gonna do something stupid.” If Pam and Jim were perfect, what fun would that be? What lesson would they take from it? None. 

Look at their final messages, the one from Pam about growing up, facing her fears, and how she was angry at herself. And even Jim’s, seeing himself become a father, seeing himself make mistakes and grow. 

You guys are mad at Jim and Pam because you think they were meant to be perfect, when no one is, and that is the point. Especially Pam, who does not have an over-the-top personality, whose flaws are not meant to make you laugh like the others’ are.",112

He came from a wealthy family with parents who didn't really love each other and his parents favoured his brother over him.

A good rule of thumb is if you need a GPU bracket to protect from sag, you probably should not send it inside the machine. 2) Don't put anything _hard_ around the PC. It gives everyone a false sense of security and it transfers external shocks into your box. Instead surround the PC with styrofoam, moving blankets,  or something that is soft that can absorb external blows and shocks and prohibit that kinetic energy transfering into the PC. So pack the PC case box inside of another box with foam surroung the inner box, as one example. It's never a 100% guarantee, but this should increase your chances.",49

So far I've found two M.2 Gen4 SSD's that I tend to recommend and these are the Kingston Fury Renegade and the WD BLACK SN850X. The reason is reliability. Having the computer starting to act up because a drive has failed is just so darned irritating and these two seem to be about as bullet proof as a SSD can be. One thing is the TBW figures for both drives. The Kingstone Fury Renegade has a TBW of 1000 per TB of drive space. So the 1TB drive has a TBW of 1000 and the 4TB drive has a TBW of 4000. This is higher than most other drives on the market. One that has a better TBW is the Seagate FireCuda 540, but the TBW is just a number the brand states and it's hard to actually verify that it is real. Something that isn't just a figure on a paper is the number of user reviews and how many of them that are negative.

First of all most people are not bothering to log into a website just to log a report that says the drive works just as expected, while those that has a problem are a lot more likely to post about it as they want others to avoid having the same problems. Also the number of posts show an approximation of how many of htese drives are actually in use, but this is even less sientific as the positive/negative relationship. 

Anyway today when I checked the web store I usually use the Kingston Fury Renegade had almost exactly 200 user reviews, and of these there were two negative. That's all. Two negative posts. One of them was a user saying his drive had failed after a few weeks ans he would never ever buy a SSD from a crappy brand like Kingston again. The other was a user who had bought the version of the drive that has a heatsink mounted  on it in the factory. His complaint was that it had been very hard to remove the heatsink. All other posts were very positive.

The WD BLACK SN850X has about 150 posts and I didn't see a single negative post other than one who had bought the drive with a heatsink and were not able to remove the heatsink. The other was someone who complained that they didn't include the small screw needed to fix the SSD in the slot. Now I don't know of any other SSD that has that screw in the package as it is something that should come with the motherboard.

A sign that the user reviews isn't filtered or curated is that the Kingston Fury Renegade is the only Kingston drive that doesn't have several complaint over failed drives. Performance degradation and such, and that with a lot fewer reviews for those drives. The other Kingston drives also has a lot lower TBW numbers than the Fury Renegade. Often less than half as high, and the higher failure rate suggests that the TBW really means something.

Another brand where all drives this webstore stock has bad ratio for good and bad reviews is Crucial. Sure they are cheap, but the number of complaints in the user posts makes me recommend against them.

Finally there's the Segate FireCuda 540, but it's a Gen5 drive and there are really not many user posts about it, seven when I looked now and all of them are positive for what that's worth. However I would guess it is a very reliable drive. They really have worked hard to get the TBW as high as possible.",5

At least after a calibration. If they weren't, they also wouldn't support 100% sRGB. 
Delta E doesn't always validate a monitor to be accurate. You can have a monitor, that measures very low at all colors, except for, say, the red color, with a delta E of 7. The average might be under 1 or 2, but the monitor is pretty useless, because it can't display proper red colors. Therefore, the max. Delta E can be just as important.
Contrast ratio is just as important, but here we unfortunately can't count on the numbers given by the manufacturers. They often exaggerate and often by a lot! A contrast ratio of1000:1 is a minimum.

The color space coverage, the manufacturers announce, are usually pretty spot on, like 98% DCI-P3. That might be measured by an independent to be around 97-99%. Apple cheats by just saying ""DCI-P3 supported"", but not a percentage. Which makes it useless.",0

The longevity of your SSD, and therefore the integrity of your data, is heavily reduced under high temperatures. 
On my pc my SSD rarely runs hotter than 40°C, and that's why it will probably last 10 years or more.
However: if it were around 70°C, as is often the case in mini pc's, I might have to replace the SSD every 2 years or so.",1

It all adds up with all the bits, I got another take on it.
like the Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Elite Ax is a good entry level Z board for the 13600k
and the board is the same price as the 13600k.

  A good Z690 board is $100 cheaper
,and DDR4 Ram is another $100 savings. All so one other thing to note is M.2 PCie 4.0 storage 1TB is super cheap at the moment and only the high end Z790 boards support the M.2 PCie 5.0 and pricey.

The 13600k would be a good match with a 240mm AIO so theres another saving.
The 13700k  really needs a 360mm AIO to get better temps.

Here is another way to view it.",4

If so, it would be greatly appreciated if you could test both with Rebar enabled and disabled, for those looking to slot it into an older system.

Here’s what Matt Bach at Puget Systems wrote about the preliminary testing with the new beta:

“So, from a performance standpoint, the Intel Arc A770 is looking very good with the new Premiere Pro 24 beta, beating the similarly priced RTX 4060 by about 15-20%. It won’t be able to keep up with a more powerful GPU like the RTX 4080 for many workflows, but if you work with a lot of LongGOP (H.264/HEVC) or Intraframe (ProRes/DNx) codecs and don’t make heavy use of GPU-accelerated effects, it could be an ideal choice – especially for those on a budget. “",8

Accidentally stumbled onto these series of interviews, and the questions and answers are very good. Especially liked how Rishabh started saying ""when you die you are answerable"". This is remarkable for our youth to keep this perspective. There is a saying ""what goes around comes around"". No matter how you look at it, living by principles do make for a happy and fulfilling life. Jesus said ""what profits a man to gain the whole world yet lose his soul""?  Keep up the good work. If we are in the top 5% income earners, then no need to cheat to get to the top 1% and so on. BTW there is a huge amount to know about finance. Printing money does not necessarily result in inflation. In 2008 after the GFC the government printed tons of money yet inflation was low, because the forces of deflation work against that of any inflation resulting from printing money. There are also other factors like M2 money, velocity of money etc. that matter for inflation.",8

Renting definitely saves money, but stability in life is equally important. For a single person, renting works fine, but for a family it becomes difficult with increasing rents, frequent shifting, and sometimes harassment from owners or societies. At some point in life, the need for owning a house outweighs everything else because a home gives you stability, freedom to renovate as per your needs, and true peace of mind.
I had been living in a rented apartment for 20 years. My parents never felt at home there and always said, ‘It would have been better if we had our own house.",123

I used it to convince my wife that we should rent, not buy. Before COVID, the sheet proved me right.

That changed when my landlord told us to vacate after we had been there for two years. I was paying ₹47,000 in rent for a house he had bought for only ₹85 lakhs. Moving is really traumatic for kids; they lose their friends, and they certainly don't understand an Excel sheet—they just look down on you for making them move.

We have now bought a house and live there. I realize that sometimes, your current self-esteem is more important than the extra money you save over 20 years to buy a BMW or a bigger house later.",62

1) Average Indian middle class are never gonna remain invested in the ups and downs of the market where we invest. They feel buying a house is better as its value doesn't go up/down much. (Its mostly because we cannot track it like stock prices)
2) The house prices are going up and will continue going up, sometimes even faster than stock market. The price rise you guys say(8-10%) on average is just the stamp duty price, actual black component shoots up more than 15% so basically buying a house in future is gonna be much costlier than buying today.
3) While calculating appreciation of property for 20 years you missed the point that people also saved rent of that 20 years so add that to the corpus, You would have paid over 1.7 cr in rent for the same house if you rented it out somewhere else, which is calculated @3% annual rent yield considering rent goes up by 10% every year. do you know what would be the rental yield of this home at the end of 20 years? Approx 18.3L yearly which is about 18% return on my initial investment of 1 cr.
4) Also, you want people to ignore real estate returns in the past but want them to consider the return of last 10-15 years as a base for stock market returns? Why? Can't the market perform a lot worse because of AI, Change in business dynamic and lot of other factors! What if the growth for india slows down now, we already have a big base for GDP, assuiming it will continue to grow at same pace is stupidity.
5) The money (corpus) you have is much bigger than what a typical middle class will ever make, so your wealth is going to compound a lot faster as compared to a normal guy. Which means you can afford to buy a house even 10-15 years down the line even if prices soars higher. But most other people won't be able to do so!",43

Same Scenario does not fit everyone.
Example is below.
In 2020 Property Rates Per Square Yard in Gurgaon was 40k to 120k from area to area. 
Same rates today are 150k to 500k in the exactly same area.

This is a return of 4 Fold of return. 

I also agree that if you would have bought the shares in 2020 of SBI or TATA Motors that would also have gone to 6-7 Fold but the difference is.
Home loan was possible but Cash investment was required in Shares.

Even if you remove the interest paid on home loan the profit is 3 to 4 fold.

This can differ area to area but rates of property rise more than 7%. Also for rent you never get the independent feeling and always governed by the owners rules and may need to change time to time.",20

UCwVEhEzsjLym_u1he4XWFkg,3610000,1270129025,748,0,YcCXsjFxbgA,🚗💡 Why buying second-hand cars often makes way more sense than going new.,3129319,"These so-called masterclasses on car buying are mostly just sales tricks. Let’s be real if you genuinely need a car for your family and can only afford a second-hand one, go for it. Nothing wrong in that at all. Just make sure you check it properly, maybe take it to a showroom, and avoid buying something too old. Sometimes urgent sales can even get you a really good deal.

If your budget allows, a new car is always better. But please don’t get trapped in EMIs that eat up half your salary—that’s not smart living.

And about luxury cars—remember, in India a huge chunk of that “1 crore car” is just GST, cess, and taxes. The base price is much lower; it only feels super expensive because of how cars are taxed here.

Also, don’t get too carried away with this “depreciating vs. appreciating asset” talk. Sure, investing in appreciating assets is important, but life is not just about that. A car is technically a depreciating asset, but so are you—one day you’re going to age and die. If you apply that logic too strictly, then don’t build a nice house, don’t spend on comfort, don’t enjoy food—just live bare minimum. That’s not life. Sometimes you need depreciating assets too, because they give you comfort and happiness while you’re alive.

The key is balance: be financially literate, know your limits, and make sure you’re not digging a hole for yourself. At the end of the day, no “masterclass” knows your life better than you do. Sit with your family, do the math, and decide what truly works for you.",728

Moi je n'ai jamais été comme eux et je n'ai jamais été fonctionnaire. J'ai lancé ma boîte mais je me rends compte aujourd'hui que j'ai des croyances limitantes et des peurs qui sont dues à mon éducation et mon passé.

Called: Playing Hide and seek in TSB
Map: Anything

Idea:
1) Use the morph emote to transform into anything
(But not the tree)

2) Hide anywhere in the map

3) The seeker will play as Genos
(Can only use Blitz Shot)

4) the seeker only get 10 shots (see what I did there?) or 2/3 mins

5) First to 5 wins is the winner

6) Hiding time 1 mins

Additionals :
 7) the winner of the previous round gets to decide the next map

8) make a tornament for all your subscriber with this idea with a reward

And if you use this idea can you credit me? You can make some changes if you want but that's all byeeeee.",1

Also, the Kizuki in that game are exclusive, just so it doesn’t break the game, and because the hype is so real. Whenever a Kizuki joins, it’s no longer a fight for fun. It’s a fight for your life.",1

He can make fake generaitors and a copy of himself that is fake (clone)that is why it pop out his face.
(The first gen u did when the killer was noli was fake,that's why u heard ""HAHA SIIIKEEE"") also he can teleport to gens thats why u saw him disapear

About gashing wound : 
 it is a combo move which means if u land it it combos the killer and does a lot of damage (it does up to 80% damage)

About chance :
Reroll chances ur health (lower or higher) the health might go to 50-150

About hat fix :
It resets the weakness to 0 and resets the charges (if u coin flip and get weakness again it will start from 1 again)

About weakness :
It makes u weaker and every attack does more damage that usual (sometines it might one shot u cuz of ur weakness)",2

1.chance if you role once if you get your gun youncan shoot it it can explode and it can not shoot you also have reroll if you get you rerole the best thing you can get is 129 hp but i younget 60 or else keep fambling untilnit gets over 100 and hat fix removes all your weaknesses snd if you have a lot of weak ness the kiler does more damage to you 
2.shedlesky he has a sword if you hit him the the sword he gets stunned run away your chicken you eat it to recover hp of 25 make sure not to that next to the killer 
3.two time you have dagger crouch and ritual make sure to place your ritual somewhere and younwill teleport now if you stab thd killer in the front it wont do naything but  give killer not to use thier move for 3 seconds and if you stab them in the back they will be stunned nad you bar will go to 50% maks sure your bar is 100 % so you cna teleport if its a lms/last man standing you will teleport to your ritual and get 118 hp or  maybe more than if ro get killed without a lms you will teleport and have only 40 hp

The craziest part about that move is the fact that your move doesn’t activate it’s cooldown right away when you use the 1, 2, or 4th move into the 3rd move to do a “fake out attack”. This means that you can do a fake-out attack, and then use the same exact move as what you chose to use while doing the fake-out attack at first. [example: using either the first, second, or fourth move, and then using the third move to immediately cancel the move to bait a move, or a counter move. And then, use the exact same first, second, or forth move that you used as a “fake out” attack right after if needed.

{I hope this comment helps with explaining what the 3rd move does 😅👍}",7

I made the order on Sunday the day this video came out and here it is less than 24 hours and the company reached out to me by email apologizing for not giving me the discount that I didn’t even know I didn’t get and yes! They have already refunded my account for that 20% discount.   Very impressive of this company to be so honorable.  Thanks Tanya and Tammy!!! Can’t wait to get my scrunchies,0

Preheat oven to 350 F
Line muffin pan with muffin inserts

DRY INGREDIENTS
2 1/2 cups almond flour
2 T coconut flour
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/4 teaspoons of salt
Whisk well! Set aside!

WET INGREDIENTS
3 large eggs room temperature 
1/3 cup Maple Syrup
1/4 cup melted EV coconut
1 teaspoons vanilla
1 Teaspoon apple cider vinegar 

Blend wet ingredients until creamy.  

Pour wet into the dry mixture folding …do not over mix.

ADD 1 cup of FROZEN blueberries…I used wild. 

Fill muffin cups 3/4 of the way…Bake for 22-25 minutes.
Add a sprinkle of cinnamon if you like.

Coconut Chia Seed Pudding
1/3 cup Maple syrup ( or Honey)
1 small bag of frozen fruit
2 cups of coconut milk ( I use So Delicious unsweetened )
1 scoop of protein powder ( I used Orgain )
2 teaspoons of vanilla
1 1/4 cup of Chia seeds

In a blender add Maple syrup, bag of fruit, coconut milk , protein powder and vanilla…blend well.
Pour over chia seeds in large bowl….whisk until fully incorporated…cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours…I like overnight

Chocolate Seed Bark
(preheat oven to 325 F) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper 
1/2 cup of  (UNSALTED) each |  pumpkin seeds, slivered almonds, chopped pistachios, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds ( or any seed/nut blend you like ) and a 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut chips or shredded 
1/4 cup of maple syrup 
2 Tablespoons coconut oil ( melted)
2 Tablespoons of Tahini

Mix together in a bowl until well incorporated.  
Spread mixture on the lined baking sheet using a spatula to flatten mixture to a thin layer…( the thinner the crispier) press it all together leaving no gaps in the seed layer . 

Bake for 15-25 minutes ( this depends on your oven, and the thickness or thinness of your seed layer …..you want it golden on the top and the edges ) Keep watch at the 15 minute mark, you do not want to burn it.

For the chocolate top layer:
Melt 1 cup of sugar free chocolate chips with 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil 
You want to be able to pour on top of your seeds layer and spread easily

When seed layer is finished baking…remove and pour chocolate layer over the top..spreading to cover the top completely…TOP with a sprinkle of flaky sea salt …(if you use salted seeds and nuts…OMIT SALT)

Allow the crunch seed layer to cool down…then place in the refrigerator to cool completely ( about 15 minutes is good)

Break into pieces. Store in the refrigerator (ENJOY)",17

I was informed I needed an operation on my ankle as I could hardly walk or straighten my leg/ankle because the tendon was very misshapen, but putting the back of my ankle right next to the lamp for 10 minutes it eased the pain. I did that every morning and evening for less than a week and unbelievably my ankle was back to normal. It blew my brains out, whenever I get any ache or open wound the RLT heals it very quickly. It wasn't cheap BUT worth every penny",2

My male gyno prescribed progesterone for me years ago when my PMS was off the charts…migraines, horrific uncontrollable crying and mood swings, and heavy periods. Saved my life. Then when it was time we moved into estrogen. I’ve lived around the world and have seen many doctors to keep my script current. They all told me that the progesterone is what counters the estrogen positively in regard to health risks. I’ve been exercising (cardio and weights) and following a balanced protein/veggie (and pasta😮) heavy diet  for basically my entire life. Just had some bloodwork done and it’s flawless.

I live in the UK , and my Lovely husband persuaded me to see our GP (General Practitioner).  It was the best thing I did, the Dr. Was absolutely amazing he drew me diagrams and took the time to explain to me what was going on. I had a load of blood tests, and other thorough examinations. I went on a small dose of Sertraline and it sorted the problem out. 8 years later and I don’t have any real menopausal symptoms any more, except I’m generally hotter than I rember being.

I'm 65 as well with very dry skin that can get easily irritated with certain products and ingriedients, especially Vitamin C and Niacinamide, and I've yet to find a V-C product that doesn't irritate my skin.  I just ordered the Prequel Gleanser, and one of their newest products, which is a half and half moisturizer which has ceramides and peptides, which I plan to layer in my skincare routine with a heavier moisturizer that they recommend doing for those of us with dry skin.  I've heard so many great reviews on all the Prequel products, so just dipping my toes into the Prequel line and hoping to try more if my skin responds well.  Thank you for doing such a thorough review!  As an aside, I first started out as a very young girl with the pink bottle of Oil of Olay, and loved it, but my current skin does not like the current Olay skin care products  for the face that so many youtubers recommend. Same with CeraVe!  There's just something in these products (Olay & CeraVe) that sets my skin on fire!  My facial skin and eyes can be so reactive to not only skin care but make up too.  Every sales person would tell me purple eyeshadow would look so great on my hazel/green eyes and I always wound up with the worst skin and eye irritation/dermatis that took weeks to resolve.  Same with pink and mauve shadows on my eyes, and browns just don't look good on me.  At this point, I just don't wear eyeshadow at all anymore because of so many awful experiences.  Same with suncreen!  Anything with limonene in it, like many Supergoop suncreen  products, irritates the heck out of my skin, just like V-C does, so I tend to stick with mineral sunscreens.  I always have to read ingredients before purchasing anything.   If you know, you know!",0

It removes all traces of makeup, and surely sunscreen too (although I don’t use sunscreen). It’s so good that I don’t even think it’s even necessary to use a face wash afterwards, but I do anyway. But I can’t imagine not using the Makeup Eraser- it’s amazing! And saves you money because you don’t need to double wash or use a liquid makeup remover!",3

I just got back to my house 30 minutes away from downtown Tampa.. I have been away for 1.5 months. And we are very fortunate and grateful that there was no damage to the house. We had a new roof put on late Spring so that was a blessing. The outside had some issues..a big oak tree fell and seems to have broken a water pipe outside. Our pond did flood but is receding.. it’s on the lawn so we are fortunate..
I love the Naturium Retinal.. works very well. I have gone thru 2 tubes so far.

So many of your answers and explanations hold true for me, which makes me happy because sometimes I feel like I'm not normal - lol! I do not know anyone in my circle of peeps that is dedicated to health and fitness. It does take discipline and structure and a routine that becomes a habit and then a permanent way of life. It's not easy. However, if you go to the grocery store and a little old man says to you, ""Wow, I saw you from behind, and that dress you're wearing was made perfectly for you. You look lovely""; well, it might just make your day and remind you that us women over 50, we still got it!

I was off the charts and have a copy of that test result in my files to prove it. I didn’t consume dairy for 10 years at that point so it’s not calcium. I also never supplemented with calcium. It’s exercise (and genetics).,10

I have been watching you for years and wanted to thank you for everything to have done for us.  A very long time ago I gave up caring.  I stop doing my makeup, gave up on my skin and hair because no one took the time to show me how to apply my makeup and care for my hair.  A friend recommended I watch you on you tube. You gave me the courage to try again. I started with the skin care journey and was amazed how my skin changed, then I tried doing make up. That has been a challenge, but I have gotten much better.   Still struggling with under eye concealers to get it look flawless. My hair has change so much from where I began by doing the deep conditioners you have recommended and using the heating caps.  I have purchased several face tools, LED face mask that have changed my skin and now I am trying the weight loss journey.  You have given me the strength to feel beautiful.  I wanted to thank you for everything to have done for me.  You are an amazing woman to care about us as much as you do, and we are all grateful for you.  Thank you.

And you look fabulous as usual.  That blue looks so good on you Tammy!  My sour dough recipe is a 2 day process but very easy.  My starter recipe is: mix package dry yeast with 1/2 cup lukewarm water.  Mix in 2 tbsp sugar, 2 tbsp warm water, 2 1/2 tbsp all purpose flour.  Combine the mixtures let stand in a glass jar covered with cloth for 5 days.  After 5 days put in refrigerator for 3-5 days uncovered. Now it’s ready to make bread but ‘feed’ it first with 3 tbsp instant potatoes flakes, 3/4 cup sugar and 1 cup warm water. Stir well and let sit on counter all day then in the evening mix up ur bread recipe and leave overnight.  In the morning punch down and divide into 3-4 loafed depending on the size u want .  Kneed a little and place in oiled loaf pans. Let rise all day.  Then in the evening bake at 350 for 30-40 min. My recipe: 6 cups bread flour  1/2 cup or less of sugar 1 tbsp salt 1 cup starter and 1 1/2 cups warm water 1/2 cup oil.  You can substitute the flour with whole wheat: 4 cups bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour.
I sometimes make cinnamon rolls.  Hope this helps. 🥰🥰🥰",13

I *love* the longer videos and really dislike this puzzling trend to post quickie videos. I'm guessing the TikTok craze is responsible?

You always seem to have something new that I haven't seen before and I can't wait to try it myself.  I don't have it out right now but Chanel has a skin illuminator that you had discovered and I ended up getting two different shades.  It is so beautiful,  Also the Makeup By Mario skin enhancer balm.  I really need to get better prepared when I talk about these things - duh,  I love love love that stuff.  Anyway, I like the longer videos, getting complete information on the product, your honest reviews - all of it.  Nothing is more irritating than those reels or short things that don't give info on the products used or you have to run around in circles on that LTK website trying to find anything.  I can't stand that app.  Nice to see you more often this week!",0

I listened to your video on how you lost the weight and a light went off in my head. I have not been able to lose a pound in years. I only had 10 miserable pounds around my waist but so very uncomfortable. When you said not to deprive yourself or cut out food groups it all made perfect sense. I have been always cutting out one thing than another and actually feeling sad that I couldn’t eat.  I made myself a program of how many calories per meal and per snacks like you said and I am never hungry or deprived. It is so simple. I can eat whatever except high carbs and I always push the protein. Today I am down 6 pounds and that is in a week. I can never thank you enough. You could  write a diet book and put an end to people living near starvation with no results. I love your channel and you are beautiful inside and out. A Fan for sure. 🎉,6

Thank you for sharing such a beautiful part of your family. Blessings from Australia ❤️❤️..Wishing Your Brother and his New Wife a Long and Happy Life Together. xoxo 🩷💙",8

There are online markets that you can buy your meats and cheeses from Italy. Let me tell you there is such a difference in the quality of food. My family is from Sicily so I still have relatives there, and whenever we have gone to visit the food is just unbelievably delicious. Greece is the same way. Congratulations to your brother and his new bride.",11

I was also blessed when I met my husband (2nd marriage for the both of us) going on 38 years in May, I thank God everyday for sending this wonderful man in my life.  On the Doodles grooming, have you ever tried Woof Gang Bakery and Grooming, I know they have locations in Florida, don’t know if you have one near you.  My Dobi has to get a medicated bath every 2 weeks, he’s a Sheltie and we’ve been doing this for over 3 years, since I go so often they gave me a break, bless them.  He has the same groomer that I book his appointments for the whole year.  He’s excellent and what I love about them is that it’s by appointment only, just like you make for your hairdresser, they are never put in a kennel, 15 minutes before he’s done they call to let you know he will be ready in 15 minutes.  Sorry for going on and on but I love my Dobi and will do whatever I have to for him, we’re blessed that we are able to.  Beautiful wedding photos, you and Lou make such a beautiful couple.🥰",0

Until you incorporate that as a daily part of your diet it is very hard to loose weight.  My son got married a year ago I was 113 lb and today I am 127lb.  I watch what i eat but I slowed down on the protein.  I go to the health club every day and spend 45 min at each class. Pilates 2 days per week strength training the other 5.  I am committed to exercise.  in the wedding pictures I noted my posture was poor.  The pilates is helping.,5

She said the usual: eat breakfast like a King, lunch like a Queen and evening meal (no later than 6pm) like a pauper, all healthy foods that I enjoy AND TO THINK THIN. 
So I bought a dress I liked in the size I wanted to be and tried it on once a week, gradually I was able to pull it up past my knees, then my hips and so on until I could eventually wear it!! To maintain this weight I continue eating this way and think thin, I find that makes a HUGE difference.
Forgot to say that I was eating more food, especially protein YET was losing weight and inches, wonderful!!",4

実は私ごとなのですが、相当前に1度、このチャンネルでリクエストをさせて頂きました。その頃は確かまだ中学生で、家庭環境やストレスによって不登校になっていた頃です。夜眠りに付けず、色んな精神安定音楽（？）のようなものを探し回っていた時に辿り着いたチャンネルがこのチャンネルでした。その時に聞いたのはディズニーメドレー。その中に入っているホールニューワールドのループ再生されたものが聞きたくて、ダメ元&興味本位でリクエストをコメント欄に書きました。その時の私は、こんなにチャンネル登録者も多く、コメントも大量にあって見つけて貰えないだろうし、独り言かのように、あったらいいなー感覚でコメントしたつもりが、本当に動画投稿をしてくださっていたことを今気づきました。本当にありがとうございます。このチャンネルを見てなかったわけじゃなく、ずっと高評価した動画を見るを繰り返していて、新着動画には目を通していなかったのです。今このことに気づき、自然と何故だか涙が溢れました。笑
どこの誰かも分からない一人の人間のことを応援してくれる人。こうやって人を喜ばせるためにリクエストに答えてくれる人がいるんだって今、ものすごく感動しています。この思いを忘れずに、ちゃんとこの残酷な世界を生き抜いてやろうと思います。ありがとう。
もしかしたらたまたまホールニューワールドのループ再生の動画が上がっただけっていう勘違いだったらお恥ずかしいです💦笑それでもでもでも！このチャンネルに助けられたことは間違いないです。本当に感謝しています。",28

人前に出ると勝手に心拍が上がって、声が震えて、上手く話すことができない。
それが中学１年生の頃からずっと、今でも続いています。
あがり症が原因で、学校生活が楽しくありません。

学校では人前で話す場面がたくさんあって、その度に私の体は震えるし、その日の前日の夜には不安でいっぱいで涙が止まりません。なんで私が、こんな思いをしなきゃいけないんだろうといつも思います。


この曲を聞くと、千と千尋の神隠しが大好きで、毎日のように見ていた小学生時代を思い出します。

何も気にせずに楽しく遊んでいて、未来にはたくさんの希望を抱いていた小学生の頃の私に、謝りたい。こんな私になっちゃってごめんねって。悔しさが溢れだしてきます。

だから、これからの未来を変えていけるように頑張りたいと思います。小学生の頃に抱いていた希望を、捨てないために。
なりたい自分になれるように。あがり症なんかのせいで、なりたい自分になれない人生のまま、終わらせたくない。

これからあがり症のことで辛くなった時は、この曲を聞いて、あの頃のことを思い出して、希望を忘れないでいようと思います。

これを聞いていたら、昨年の夏に亡くなった母とディズニーに行った時のことを思い出しました。
いつもそばにいてくれて子供の事をいつも第一に考えてくれていたお母さんはこの世にはもういません。
でも、俺の心の中には思い出として一生残り続けます。
ここのコメントを読んで、辛いのは俺だけじゃないんだなと改めて実感させられました。
中学生の俺がこの世に与えられる力は微塵もないと思いますが、これだけは。
俺は母をくも膜下出血で亡くしました。いきなりのことだったので今考えると後悔しかありません。
でも、その中でも気付いたことは、命を大切にするのはもちろんのことですが、俺のようにいきなり愛する人や、家族、友人などを亡くされた方もいらっしゃると思います。
その方たちが大切な人を亡くした今、出来ることは亡くなった方に胸を張って楽しい！と言えるように生きることだと思います。
そして、時々その方との思い出を思い返すことだと思います。
こんな俺の言葉なんて響くことはないと思いますがw
皆さん、今日もお疲れ様です。
いつかきっと、みんなでマスクなしで笑い合える日が来ます。
それまで、出来る範囲で楽しく生きましょう！
こんな中学生の長文をわざわざ読んでいただきありがとうございました。",63

サークルも入りました。いい友達がたくさんできて嬉しかったけど意地悪の先輩にいつもイントネーションの真似をされて自分の日本語に自信がなくなり、お喋りだった自分が一言も喋れなくなりました。

興味のない学科に入ったので勉強にも集中できずストレスがどんどん溜まっていき、2年生の春学期が終わった頃にはもう帰りたいという気持ちになってしまいました。春学期が終わって夏が来て、帰省して親に泣きながらはなしました。そして、帰って来ました。

帰ってきてしばらくはすごく楽しかったです。母国語でべらべら誰とも話せるというのがとても嬉しかったです。一年くらいは休んでいいって許可ももらっていっぱい休みました。

でも、帰って来てから一年が経った時、自信満々だった自分が恥ずかしい、金を出してくれた親に申し訳ないという考えが止まらず毎日が鬱になって今まで続いてます。

それからここの大学の編入を準備してはいますが、あと少しで帰って来てから2年。何も達成してることがない自分が嫌いです。自分のいいところが１つも見つからないです自分のことがどうしても好きになれないです。

今日もずっとこうやって頭の中がぐちゃぐちゃで全然眠れなくてユーチューブを開いたらおすすめにこの動画が出てきました。子供の頃からジブリが好きだったからって単純に音楽を聴くためにきましたが、コメ欄を見てずっと泣きました。日本語が読めてよかったって思いました。ありがとうございます。心があたたかくなってやっと眠れそうです。

誰にも話したことない話を一度はしてみたくてこんなに長文書いてしまいました。もし読んでくださった方がいたらありがとうございます。皆さんには毎日が幸せで溢れてほしいです。おやすみなさい",4771

いつもどんな時も僕の人生にはディズニーが関わっていた。
まだ16年しか生きてないのに、ディズニーに支えられてきた。
反抗期やめたきっかけはリロ&スティッチだった。
人を差別しないように心がけるようになったのは美女と野獣や、ノートルダムの鐘だったな。
友達を大切にしようと思ったのはトイストーリーだった。
星に願えば叶うなんて話はありえない。事実、ディズニーの主人公達は自分で行動して成功を勝ち取っている。
あきらめないで行こう、ズートピアのあの歌にもある通りだと思う。
でも努力しているとやめたくなる時だってある。
自分も受験勉強が嫌で志望校を諦めた身だ。
でも努力した友達と僕と同じ努力しなかった友達の顔を見ると光がないように感じる。
僕はたまたま入った高校が恵まれていたから良かったが、そうじゃない人もいる。
だから、恵まれた環境を作ってくれている、僕と関わりのある人たちに感謝して僕は生きる。
その人たちに何かできないか考えながら。
人の役に立てるような人間になりたい。
決して、ディズニーの主人公達のように輝こうとは思ってない。
でも、夢を持つのは誰だって同じ。
人の夢を馬鹿にする奴は、夢を諦めた奴だ。
だから人の夢を馬鹿にしない。

星に願いをかけることを教えてくれたディズニーと生まれてから今まで育ててきてくれたディズニー好きの両親に感謝して僕は努力します。
いつか、誰かに夢を与えられる人間になるために。",665

新学期、配られた新しい教科書の匂い


学校から帰宅して、ランドセルを下ろしながら一目散に台所に立ってるお母さんに走って行き 今日あった出来事を一生懸命伝えるのが楽しくて


土曜日、午前の授業が終わって家に帰ると、お父さんがいるのが嬉しくて

リビングいっぱいに広がるお父さんの飲むコーヒーの香りが好きで


夜眠れない時、泣いたあとお母さんにポンポンしてもらって甘えるのが気持ちよくて




すごくすごく、鮮明に思い出します。



今隣に6ヶ月になる娘がスヤスヤ寝ています。

彼女はまだ、ジブリは見たことがないけれど、この曲達をかけると、いつもすぐ寝息を立てながら眠りにつきます。

この子の成長とともに、ずっと聴かせてあげたい。
いつかこの子が大人になった時、懐かしいな、居心地がいいな、と思えるものを残してあげたい。


そしてわたしも、娘をポンポンしながらこの曲を聴いて、たまには涙しながら、また明日頑張ろうって思える。


素敵な時間を
ありがとうございます。",1805

助かりませんでした。
その時は全く現実感がなく、気がついたら3日経っていてお葬式の真っ最中でした。
本当に辛くて悲しい時って涙は出ないのだと初めて知りました。
ある程度落ち着いた頃やっと初めて涙が出てきて止まりませんでした。
何かしていないと苦しくて必死に仕事して、必死に生きようとしました。
そうしたら僕の心が壊れてしまいました。
仕事中に泣き、お客さんに心配される始末で仕事にならず。
帰り、家で1人でいると死ぬ事しか考える事ができませんでした。
もういっそ死んでしまおうと思い、彼女が飛び降りた屋上へ行き僕も飛び降りようとしました。
ふと気がつくと誰かに思いっきり引っ張られ後ろへ倒れました。
誰だろうと思い振り返ると誰もいませんでした。
不思議に思いましたがなんか冷めてしまい自宅に帰りました。
夜、寝ていると夢を見ました。
そこは彼女とよく行った思い出の場所で、目の前に死んでしまった彼女が居ました。
まだこっちに来てはダメ、私の分まで生きて
私の分まで幸せになって
そう言われた気がしました。
目が覚めてもう何時間かわからなくなるほど泣きました。

あれから10年間、必死に生きてきました。
やりたい事をやり、人の2倍人生を楽しもうと決意して。
そして今は大事な人がそばに居てくれています。
とても幸せです。
あの時後ろへ引っ張ってくれたのは彼女だったと思います。
引っ張ってくれてありがとう。
助けてくれてありがとう。
君のおかげで今僕はとても幸せです。
そっちへ行ったらたくさん話しましょう。
話したい事がいっぱいある。




これを見てくれた人へ

どんなに絶望しても、どんなに希望を失っても
自ら命を断とうとしないでください。
誰かが必ず悲しみます。
誰かが貴方を想ってくれている事を決して忘れないでください。
そして、頑張り過ぎないでください。
ちゃんと休んで、毎日を楽しんでください。
いつか必ず幸せになれる日がきます。
言いたい事がごちゃごちゃで伝わらないかも知れないけど。
どんなに辛くても生きてください
その倍、幸せがきっと訪れます
僕が1番言いたい事はこれだけです。

皆さまいい夢を。

1. You need to warm up the supplied air, otherwise all heat is spent on heating cold air, and not on heating the sample (It is physics!).
2. Add limestone to the width to reduce the melting point of slag.
3. Do agglomeration, i.e.
Make briquettes from a mixture of ore and coal (+Caco3)
4. Reduce heat loss by increasing the thickness of the walls of the furnace.

You have reached a point where the pressure differential between the top of the chimney and the narrowing is greater than the force of the gasses coming from the fire below.  This creates suction of fresh air, but then that air is cooler lowering the chimney pressure.  At which point the pressure of gasses coming from the fire below is now higher than in the chimney.  This back and forth cycle is the pulse.  This opening is essentially acting similar to the valve in a conventional pulse jet.

You could in theory tune this by changing size and placement of the door.  Or by changing the height of the chimney. 

Change this in one direction and you’ll get a steady stream of air with the door open.  Change it the other way and you’ll start to get to the point where combustion at the bottom will slow and combustible gasses will build leading to high force detonations happening.  The latter would in theory produce thrust but in this case would likely cause the lower chamber to explode and collapse in on itself.

Although these pulses could be useful in some situations, they would cap the temperature of your smelt.",431

By simply having it be taller, but keeping the charging cycle similair, you'll cause a lot more air to get sucked into the furnace as the hot air shoots up the chimeny and causes suction. Makes the whole thing more efficient. There's a reason every smelter I've ever seen work well is fairly tall. usually chest high or a bit shorter. If the flames are sitting on the edge like that, it's not tall enough. This will also keep more of the heat in place to melt the iron.

Last time, you used an open crucible, severly and regretably contaminating and probably burning away the end product.
2 things: 1 make a closed crucible mold. One flat piece with desired shape, put the prills in, seal with a slab on top. Leave a very small, horizontal hole to allow air to escape, maybe a hollow piece of grass. The oxygen, ash and charcoal really should not be any where near the molten metal.
2: make a small, 10cm high ceramic table for the mold to sit on.

It’s an upside-down clay pot with an inlet valve and an outlet spout. The inlet valve is simply a hole in the pot with a leaf plastered to the inside with wet clay so that it forms a one-way flap valve. When pushed down into water, the valve shuts and air is forced out of the spout and into the fire. When the pot is lifted in water, air is sucked in through the open inlet valve and the cycle repeats. 

I got the idea from a Food and Agriculture Organization website I saw years ago. A Google image search for “FAO water bellows” gives an image of someone using a more complicated version at a brick forge in Zimbabwe, possibly from 1994, but I can no longer find the original diagram or description. From memory, the air and water containers were steel drums and there was a U-shaped pipe to convey the air down from inside the air drum when lowered, through and out the water drum and into the fire. Air entered an inlet valve in the top of the air drum when lifted. There may also have been an outlet valve which would presumably have been located on the outlet pipe. The pipe remained stationary through the cycle. 

My design is a simplified version of this with a spout leading directly from the air pot into the fire. The spout moves with the pot instead of being fixed in place as it is raised and lowered. The spout nose is resting in place on the ground in front of the fire acting as a hinge, with the whole unit acting as a lever. If the nose of the spout is resting in the entrance of a fixed tuyere (air pipe) then the angle of the jet can be kept constant with the added advantage of the venturi effect drawing in more air. My design also only has one valve (inlet) for simplicity. 

The bellows produced a similar effect to the traditional blacksmith bellows without requiring leather to build. It seems to produce a higher-pressure jet of air than the blower I’ve used previously. It’s also less complicated to build, with fewer perishable materials and has fewer moving parts that often break or seize during use. It should be easier to maintain, more ergonomic and require less skill to use. My next step is to conduct a test iron smelt with the existing prototype and compare its performance with the old blower. Possible improvements could be made where it would be made a double acting bellows with two connected pots similar to the Peruvian whistle jar but with 4 valves to direct air flow. It could also be made larger or two could be used at the same time.",3436

The attempt to form a forgeable bar was disappointing although it was a better than expected casting.

I will probably follow this method of decarburization rather than low temperature annealing in future.

Prior to this, my blowers would spin one way, stop, and then spin the other way during each cycle. With the new method, the stick and rope are pulled down and back on the power stroke causing the rotor to spin clockwise. Then the stick and rope are lifted up and forwards, loosening the ropes grip on the rotor, allowing it to continue to spin clockwise due to momentum. Thanks to the new mode of operation, continuous, one-way rotation is produced, conserving energy by not having rotation intermittently cease during each cycle and allowing for more efficient volute shaped housings to be used to direct the air as opposed to the old symmetrical housing design which were necessary for the old technique to work.

There are many factors to getting a good smelt with this method but it is possible as there are records of natural draft iron smelting furnaces in ancient times. The benefit of such a furnace is the lack of bellows needed and so less labor is used.

It was suggested that even with the hand crank ratio of 1:1, the advantage would be apparent over the original intermittent high rpm blower powered with a string.  This blower prototype produced a high volume but low pressure air flow due to the sacrifice of rpm due to the 1:1 ratio. I did some rough calculations after making it and think that if the fan were scaled up to 1m as opposed to the 50 cm fan in the video, it might start to compete with the original blower design for the current rpm. I made a 1 m diameter fan but was unwieldy though it might have worked with more testing, time constraints prevented using it in this project.

Roasting the ore improved the yield about 2 times though this might have been due to decreasing the volume and effectively increasing the concentration of the ore. Adding lime (snail shells) ruined the smelt and produced next to no iron. This may be due to the ore already being basic and chemistry and the lime made it so basic that the slag won't flow. Sand (an acid flux) or old slag might make a better flux for this type of ore, lime might be better used to flux iron sand (acidic due to the silica content). Finally, I tested re-smelting the slag from previous smelts (not the slag from the lime smelt). The result was about half the iron came out compared to fresh ore, which suggests that slag should be smelted again to recover any iron not obtained during the first smelt if fresh ore is hard to come by.

As a metallurgy engineer that handles ore into kiln, I have the following advice:
I suggest you start with smaller fire and continuously build it up to increase the temperature, but it is important to keep a calm fire after starting it. Drying the ore slowly is the key to a nice and ready charge for the coal. Once you start adding coal (after 3-4 hours of drying the ore), I suggest you try making breaks while blowing, to let the coal and the charge cook well, like cooking a steak at a low temperature, because too much air will oxidize the iron earlier before it reaches a temperature near liquid phase before smelting, so that could be the problem why you are still getting small prills. Try making small pellets of 1 cubic centimeter of the ore. Burning the iron ore right from the start will cause the iron to pop and form into smaller prills into the slag.
Also lime is added in liquid metal only (from my experience so far)
Hope this helps!",6627

These are the 3 methods I've used so far. The pit is the quickest and easiest to set up. But the mound and kiln produce better quality and larger pieces. All charcoal from these methods will work in smelting and forging but the 2 later methods make better fuel.  The advantage of the kiln over the mound is that it's re-useable and takes less effort to set up per batch than the mound does (less exposed wood to cover with mud). Also, I've started sieving the charcoal so all pieces used are over about 2.5 cm/1 inch. The larger lumps work better in furnaces because there are larger gaps between them that allow air to pass more easily through the fuel bed.

So I shaped the bacteria into pinch pots and dried them to see if they set hard and wouldn't dissolve in water afterwards (remember no fire was used in this whole process). Surprisingly it worked and formed these water insoluble pots . I'm not sure on the chemistry behind it but I think it's due to water soluble iron 2 oxide in the bacteria becoming water insoluble iron 3 oxide when they dry out and oxidize. This reaction probably causes the material to cement together. It might be a useable mortar where iron bacteria is abundant.,7852

When ever I smelt local ores it always produces cast iron prills rather than softer blooms of low carbon iron as one would expect from the bloomery process. I believe this because the prills are very hard, but when struck hard enough they shatter rather than flatten.

Cast iron is iron that has a high carbon content (when arranged by carbon content: Cast iron>Steel>iron). Cast iron has a lower melting point and is harder compared to regular iron. But it is more brittle so it's nearly impossible to forge. So I figured out how to decarburize it after some experiments. 

First I tried making an ingot to work on but it didn't cast properly. Then I tried rusting the iron to oxidize the metal before melting so it would decarburize the cast iron during the melt (similar to the ""wet puddling"" process in metallurgy). But this gave an incomplete melt also.

The method that finally worked was simply melting the cast iron in front of the air blast till the carbon burnt out in the oxygen rich zone of the forge. This caused the cast iron prills to melt together in a single blob that I then was able to hammer flat while yellow hot. 

This method is similar to the ""stir fried steel/ 炒钢"" process in ancient China or the ""Osmond process"" in Europe. It's done where ever cast iron needs to be converted to a lower carbon to be forged. I've seen videos about carburizing iron on youtube but none about decarburizing cast iron.",7007

One of the characters is standing at the centre of a human space empire. Within the most important palace on Earth. And finds himself in a museum wing called ""The Hall of Victories"". Which is cherishing the accomplishments of human race in the distant space-faring future.

It contains a variety of technological achievements. Some military, most scientific. Such as the first stable human cloning formula. The first Titan rover. The first faster-than-light navigation circuit, etc. But in the middle of the museum is the centrepiece. A display case containing several shards of dented clay. Forming the outline of some sort of bowl.

Hundreds of thousands of years old.

The character expresses confusion at the placement. Pointing out that it's so simple a child could make it. But another character explains why it's so crucial. That without that bowl, all the other museum exhibits wouldn't exist. That at some point in the unrecorded past, one of our primitive ancestors noticed that a type of mud hardened when left in the sun. And he or she decided that they were going to MAKE something.

Due to some concerns from the subreddit, I've reached out to John Plant, owner of the Primitive Technology YouTube channel, for an update on his status during this pandemic, and because he hasn't released new videos for a few months now.

I'm happy to be able to report that John is doing well and everything is fine. He thanks us for our concern and... has a nice surprise for us:

He's unfortunately not allowed to reveal any details at this time, but John is currently taking a break from YouTube because he is working on a project for a cable network!

Hope you all stay safe and healthy!

Πρέπει να σου πω ένα μεγάλο ευχαριστώ που με έβαλες σε αυτόν τον όμορφο κόσμο των καλλυντικών και της περιποίησης του προσώπου!!
Είμαι 60 χρονών και μέχρι τώρα χρησιμοποιούσα σπάνια κρέμες (το καλοκαίρι σχεδόν καθόλου και το χειμώνα μόνο αν με «τραβούσε» το δέρμα μου) και αυτό γιατί είμαι ας πούμε καλή κράση και δεν ένιωθα ότι το έχω ανάγκη μιας που πάντα έδειχνα και δείχνω πιο μικρή καμία 10ετια, άρα για εμένα ήταν χαμένος χρόνος και vanity το να ασχοληθώ με τον εαυτό μου… 
Έχω δει τα περισσότερα βιντεακια σου (και όχι μόνο μια φορά το καθένα χαχα!!) και ΝΑΙ με ΕΠΕΙΣΕΣ να ασχοληθώ με ΕΜΕΝΑ και την επιδερμίδα μου. Είσαι τόσο αναλυτική και την ίδια στιγμή περιεκτική που με έπεισες να φτιάξω μια ρουτίνα πρωινή και μια βραδινή. Αγόρασα  toner, essence, ampoule (άγνωστες λέξεις μέχρι στιγμής για εμένα) και αντιηλιακή προσώπου!! Βασικά από όλα αυτά τα προϊόντα που μας έχεις δείξει εκανα μια δική μου επιλογή με βάση τις δικές μου ανάγκες και εδώ και μια εβδομάδα ακολουθώ κατά γράμμα το τελετουργικό της περιποίησης ( στραβομουτσουνιάζοντας τις πρώτες μέρες γιατί θεωρούσα αυτό το τεταρτακι που μου έπαιρνε η όλη ρουτίνα χάσιμο χρόνου)….αλλά το έκανα!!.. και ….να σου την τρίτη μέρα το πρωί που όπως έριχνα νερό στο πρόσωπο μου για να ξυπνήσω κοιτάζομαι στον καθρέφτη και είδα διαφορά στο δέρμα μου!! Ήταν πιο φωτεινο!! Πιο λείο!!! Πιο σφριγηλό !! Άγγιξα με το χέρι μου το κόκκαλο που είναι κάτω από τα μάτια και πια δεν ένιωθα ένα πετσί με ένα κόκαλο από κάτω!! Είχε γεμίσει το δέρμα μου και ήταν και απαλό!! Τα μάτια μου δεν είχαν αυτούς τους συνηθισμένους μαύρους κύκλους από κάτω και το δέρμα δεν ήταν πια τόσο διάφανο ώστε να φαίνονται τα αγγεία!! ΤΡΕΛΑΘΗΚΑ!! ΜΕΣΑ ΣΕ 3 ΗΜΕΡΕΣ!!
Και ακριβώς αυτό θα ήθελα να πω και να μοιραστώ με εσένα Δήμητρα και όλες τις φίλες που σε ακολουθούν, ότι αυτό το μισάωρο την ημέρα, σου αποδίδει τόσα πολλά!! Το λέει μια δύσπιστη που ενώ αγόραζα κρέμες ποτέ δεν τις έβαζα (πέταξα χτες ακριβές κρέμες ανέγγιχτες που είχαν λήξει!!)
Καλή συνέχεια σε όλες!!",2

Λόγω μαύρων στιγμάτων που έχω χρόνια (είχα σταματήσει να κάνω peeling για χρόνια γιατί δεν έβλεπα απόδοση λόγω κακών προϊόντων) μου πρότειναν και πήρα τώρα για καλοκαίρι το Anua Heartleaf Moisture Peeling gel και Anua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Serum. Έχω δει τρομερή διαφορά από την πρώτη μέρα όσον αφορά μαύρα στίγματα και πόρους σε ευαίσθητη-μεικτή επιδερμίδα.

Peeling Gel: Κάνω για αρχή 2 φορές την εβδομάδα, έπειτα θα το μειώσω. Δεν με ενόχλησε καθόλου γενικά, αφήνει την επιδερμίδα υπέροχη. Τις πρώτες φορές χρήσης έβγαλα 1-2 κοκκινίλες όμως ένιωθα πως ξεσπάει το δέρμα επειδή καθαρίζει και όχι επειδή με πειράζει το προϊόν. Μετά τις 2 χρήσεις πέραν του ότι έχω εμφανή αποτελέσματα δεν έχω και καμία έξαρση. Το χρησιμοποιώ όταν ξέρω πως δεν θα φύγω από το σπίτι και πιο πολύ μεσημέρι προς βράδυ, όμως ακόμα και μεσημέρι που το χρησιμοποιησα και έπειτα με είδε ο ήλιος δεν είχα κανένα θέμα εφόσον τοποθέτησα καλή ενυδατική και καλό-καταπραυντικό αντηλιακό.

Anua Niacinamide 10% + TXA 4% Serum: Χρήση μόνο βράδυ και δεν θέλει μεγάλη ποσότητα (μόνο 2-3 σταγονίτσες αλλιώς βγαίνει λιπαρότητα), ήδη βλέπω διαφορά από τις πρώτες χρήσεις και η επιδερμίδα είναι ενυδατωμένη, δεν βγάζει καμία απολύτως λιπαρότητα και παρατηρώ πως βοηθάει με τα μαύρα στίγματα και τους πόρους. Περιμένω να καταλλήξω σε άποψη μετά από περισσότερο χρόνο χρήσης.

Τι υπέροχα αυτά τα κορεάτικα! Δεν έχω δει την επιδερμίδα μου ποτέ ξανά σε τόσο καλή κατάσταση και έχω δοκιμάσει πάρα πολλά γνωστά ευρωπαϊκά προϊόντα. Ευχαριστώ και για την βοήθεια σου, έχω βρει διαμάντια μέσα από τα βίντεο σου.",1

Η γκάμα των αποχρώσεων στα φυσικά καταστήματα είναι διαφορετική από αυτή του notino πχ που τα έχει αρκετά οικονομικότερα.

NVDA should consolidate around the $200 level before any further progress. But personally I think NVDA is a bit overhyped. They only design the chips they rely on others to build them.

GPU sales are already decreasing and are down 42% year over year.   Their consumer GPUs are priced based off of that elevated demand.  For anyone who games the prices are way out of whack with historic trends and affordability.  NVDA is going to have to lower their prices, it is, inevitable.  Add in the fact that their newest GPUs are only good unless you have a $1000 4k monitor.  The idea of a nice GPU to game on is the most expensive it has ever been.  As NVDA rallies to 160 (if it gets that far) sell it... It's probably going to 80 before the bear market is over.",0

Enjoyed your content👍

So I have 100 shares and wish to begin a journey on my 2nd 100 shares. Well, I actually did begin and had 18 shares which I sold on the 8th of July @ 753.34 so I’m ready to take it on poco poco with a little gift timing the market.
My average is not terrific for the first 100 shares but that is ok. I will just park them off to the side and go forward …

I’m shooting for the 🌙 and hope to land sometime in the next couple years 🚀

However, I have huge respect for doing that unlike the rest 90% of British population wasting money on pubs, concerts, luxury cars, clothes, etc. 
Also saw ur linkedIn, u work in consulting which is great! 

I almost follow same strategy saving 50% of my after tax income, but as a 23yo immigrant, not in corporate field, I could only save £1k/month, could you please tell me a platform I could maximise my savings for a 10months - 12months.

A viewer rightly pointed out that rebalancing inside a GIA (General Investment Account) can have tax implications and create extra admin because of the sell/buy orders. If your gains from those sales go over the annual CGT allowance (£3,000 in 2025/26), you’ll need to report it on your self-assessment and pay Capital Gains Tax on the excess.

👉 In my video I was referring specifically to rebalancing inside my ISA, where you don’t need to worry about those tax implications. To be clear, I personally avoid using the rebalance button often — usually only once a year if allocations drift significantly.

So if you’re using a GIA, just be mindful that rebalancing has extra tax admin attached. As always, please do you own research.",2

This is OK inside an ISA but in a GIA it can cause a problem because you will have to work out the capital gains for your self-assessment tax form each year if it is over 3k of gains. You may have 50+ sell transactions in a tax year and you have to take into account the same day rule, 30-day rule and section 104 rule. Also, these rules apply across ALL your GIA accounts if you have GIAs with other brokers.  e.g. selling 10k SWDA on IE GIA and then buying 2k SWDA on Trading 212 on GIA Invest account within 30 days due to clicking 'rebalance' would mean the 30-day rule would apply.

An ISA is use it or lose it whereas a pension you can go back and use unclaimed allowances up to three years.

Why not take out a 25 year interest only mortgage and put the difference in monthly payments into an ETF or similar?

If you can't afford to pay for it in cash, you shouldn't get it. The normal costs such as insurance, maintenance, and gas are already alot of money.  Furthermore, once you buy a car, keep it. I'm 53 and I have bought  3 used cars, 2 of which were unfortunately totalled in no-fault accidents, and one new car which has lasted me over 18 years.  In the rest of my lifetime, I see myself buying either 2 new cars or 4 used ones, all in cash.",3
UCCpXy4y4McbV9Aege_yPASg,39600,4776282,175,2,kgXo1dYdTQA,How Much Car Can You Really Afford in Canada? (By Salary),2552,"You can do so well in used-car hunting if you look for cars where the manufacturer did really well but for one reason or another the market didn't appreciate the vehicle. In especially competitive segments like, say, small- or mid-size crossovers or SUVs, the most popular vehicle usually gets the most sales but is often only slightly better than the competition. This has allowed me to buy cars that I ENJOY DRIVING, and that are very well-equipped for Canadian winters, and so I don't feel like I'm suffering or just getting by.

Then you maintain them with all the money you're saving from not making car payments, or at least not such large ones, and you can drive some of these things forever.

I still drive my 2009 Acura TL with over 340,000 km on the clock. Aside from consumables (brakes, tires) and service interval items (timing belt, water pump, spark plugs) I've had to replace a wheel bearing and a radiator. At the 300,000 km mark I did a big suspension refresh: shocks/struts, swaybar bushings, and swaybar links which made the car ride like new again. I bought the car in 2013 with 79,000 km for half its new price. It was a one-owner West Coast lease return (I live in Alberta) and had sat on the lot for nearly four months because the ""power plenum"" grille was very controversial -- the big ugly beak on Acuras of that era caused the TL, a magnificent car, to depreciate rapidly, which was to my advantage. Put all-weather (not all-season) tires on a SH-AWD TL and you are simply unstoppable in Canadian winters. It's unreal. You can find a low-mileage 4th-gen TL now for LESS than I paid in nominal dollars for it 12 years ago, and inflation has made that a very cheap price indeed; in 2012 I paid $24k and I routinely see low-mileage examples under $18k.

Three years ago we replaced an end-of-life Volvo with a 2018 Lincoln MKX Reserve 2.7L. Also four years old with 78,000 km. I had been watching a review of the Genesis GV70 and was impressed by all the features: twin-turbo V6 power; great stereo; massaging seats. It started me wondering if there wasn't a less-loved competitor that performed nearly as well. For two generations, Lincoln had been tarting up the Ford Edge and trying to get Lexus money for them. With the 3rd-gen MKX they finally got serious about making good cars again; in 2019 the MKX was rebadged the Nautilus and given a new front fascia and swapped the 6-speed for a newer 8-speed but inside it is the identical car. The Revel Ultima stereo--the best of 3 available sound systems, which even Lincoln dealers sometimes label wrong, so do your homework--is simply the best I've ever heard, and I DJed for 17 years when I was younger and used to run competition car audio in the 90s. I paid $27,900 for what, four years earlier, had been a $74,000 car. My MKX had been traded into a Lexus dealership and came with a full service history; the original owner had had everything, down to every oil change, done at the dealer.

And so on. I pointed out to my teenage and young-adult kids that even if I just replaced the Acura every five years with another, four-year-old used car, it would have eaten up money that we instead have spent on family trips to France, Barbados, and Singapore. And the money I've saved compared to buying new? My retirement accounts have earned over $100k in that time on the back of money I didn't spend on new vehicles.

All this is just trying to bolster the message of the video with some specific examples. You can get really, really great pricing on vehicles that have top safety ratings from the IIHS, great reliability (with forums full of solutions to common problems), and are a lot of fun to drive in exchange for a few dozens of hours of homework. It can be some of the most financially valuable time you ever spend.",1

The only way I come out ahead of them is if I move overseas. Meanwhile they stay in Canada and get the GIS.

UCCpXy4y4McbV9Aege_yPASg,39600,4776282,175,2,t9ewE4rpZb0,15 Reasons to Leave Canada Forever,15819,"It's not just how high the taxation is, it's what is taxed that is even worse. They are heavily taxing businesses and investments. On paper, it looks somewhat reasonable, but in reality it is not.  Operating a business and investing your money, means you are taking a risk, what the tax does is reduce the risk to reward ratio, less reward means you are less willing to take the leap, and that has a repressive effect on innovation, competitiveness, and the economy in general. If you reinvest earnings, there's no break at all, you'll still be taxed as usual, leaving you with less money to reinvest, which is counterproductive. The small business tax rate seems reasonable, until you realize it's only applicable on up to $500K profit, an amount that in today's business world, is a very small amount of money, the threshold is outdated and far too low. In addition, the tax on earnings that eventually make it to the shareholders, is taxed at the highest rate, there are no breaks at all for the people who take the risks and operate businesses. For investors, the taxation on cap gains is significantly higher than is widely advertised, it is more than the 50% inclusion with 50+% deducted, it's more like the 2/3 inclusion despite the 2/3 inclusion being dropped. What Mark Carney's government did after dropping the 2/3 inclusion increase, was to secretly increase it again, using the largely unknown AMT, bringing it back up to almost the same as before - thanks for nothing Mark Carney! I do plan to keep voting, except this time with my feet, and with my money. There's an exit tax to leave Canada, however, I can keep my money in Canada, and move my business somewhere else, it will be the ultimate middle finger to a backwards repressive tax system that I am thoroughly fed up with. The super high tax I pay, would not be so bad if I qualified for all the programs my tax money is paying for, except each year, it seems less becomes available because after you earn a certain amount, you'll no longer qualify, yet they expect you keep on paying the most in taxes. Thanks for nothing, Canada! I'm not even against paying taxes, all I want to see is fairness, and a much less repressive counterproductive taxation system put in place. I do NOT want to leave Canada, but from a business point of view, it makes sense to leave.",16

There are 20 or 10 years to go and things are changing rapidly. For example: Pilar #1 from this video (Vison) is absolutely useless as at the end your savings will define your retirement situation, no matter what your vision and how big your dream was at age 40. Pilar #2 is also not very helpful. You can't save more than certain portion of your income. So it is just a matter of committing yourself to  save certain amount of money per month instead of unnecessary spending. Pilar #3 is important but it basically saying - Save as much as you can when you can.

Retirements were created for a population that had an average lifespan of 60 with a an average retirement age of 57 and a birthrate of 4... But now our life expectancy is over 80 with a an average retirement age of 65 and a birth rate of 1.2 kids per woman. CPP is an absolute and total scam. We need to cut CPP and all other retirement benefits immediately. Or at least recognize that it is an old people tax that you will never get to benefit from unless you are over 60 years old right now.,1

So if you don't have anything that is subject to capital gains tax, you won't pay the exit tax. (TFSAs, RSPs, cash in the bank, primary residence are all exempt from the departure tax.) I left Canada a few years ago, declared non-residency and was out of the country for 6 years and never filed an income tax return in 5 of those 6 years (the year before you leave you file your last tax return).

I kept my drivers licence active during this time. (I even renewed it when I came back to Canada for a family visit!). I also kept my 3 bank accounts and 4 credit cards. And I never informed my credit cards or banks that I had moved abroad. Why? They have no right to know that. Everything is online. I get my statements and pay them online. There's absolutely no reason for them to know I'm abroad.

I had to return to Canada because my mom got ill and I needed to look after her. When I returned to Canada, I simply started paying taxes again. There was absolutely zero issue from keeping all of these other things active in Canada and I never heard from CRA or my banks.

The only big issue I encountered when I returned was getting my provincial health insurance back. I gave them the proof they wanted but it was always never good enough. I went in about 5 times and they kept wanting other documents. In other words, they kept moving goal posts.

When I was rejected on my fifth visit, I was so fed up with dealing with them that my dad suggested I go to my local MLA/MPP to complain. Despite the fact that he was a Conservative and the Liberals were the government, he managed to get the Ontario Health Minister directly involved with my case, who gave the healthy ministry hell. Because within 48 hours (after being rejected) the local provincial health office called me up and said: ""Come on in. You have been approved.""

WOW!!! Who would have thought that governments sometimes actually serve the people ... and in such a direct way!




So, if you do come back and have a problem getting your health card back ... if you're following all the rules, and they still give you the run-around I highly recommend contacting your local MLA or MPP (depending on the province). Remember, they're there to serve you!",75

If you are interested in living in another country and open to learn a new culture and new experiences, then migrating is something I would definitely recommend.

I’m one of those rare individuals with multiple indexed pensions from multiple govt sources. My spouse has 2 different govt pensions as well. Each pension offers a 50% survivor benefit. One of mine has a 100% survivor benefit if I die from a military service related injury. Plus there are other death benefits… most net worth calculators exclude pensions as you cannot cash them out.  I am finding it difficult to create a plan that incorporates my pensions, benefits, and investments for tax planning / saving purposes. 

I’m in my early 50s and already accessing my fully indexed govt pensions except OAS and CPP. I haven’t touched my investments and I will have my house paid off in 6 more years. I won’t need to sell it for income either. Once my house is paid off I would like to travel but don’t know how much I can safely spend. I even had a financial planner create a plan for me as part of the services offered by my investment company but it’s not very helpful. He didn’t calculate my CPP benefits or offer any tax planning advice on using my RRIF. How do most advisors treat cola indexed defined pension income?",0

You're even allowed to keep your drivers licence. The big things are getting rid of your house (or renting it to a person that is ""arms length"" away from you, i.e., not a family member). You also need to have residency in another country (and be able to prove that with official ID), before Canada will let you go. And CRA will determine the date you left to be the last of these 3 dates: (1) The date you left; (2) the date your spouse and dependents left, if applicable; and (3) the date you became a resident of another country. If you already have residency in another country and have no dependents or spouse, then it all boils down to the date you left will be considered the date you became a non-resident.

Also to note ... the exit / departure tax is only a tax on ""unrealized capital gains"" (as he mentions in the video). If all your assets are in cash and sitting in the bank, even if you have $1 Billion of cash, you will not have to pay this exit tax, as cash has already been taxed. My suggestion is to sell everything and reacquire once you've left. That way, when you sell it, you'll pay capital gains tax on it when you sell it and, when you leave, all you'll have is the cash from those sales of assets.

And remember ... your primary home is not subject to capital gains tax and, as such, is also exempt from this exit tax. Likewise, RSPs, RIFs and TFSAs are exempt as well. And, if you have RSPs or RIFs and you're moving abroad, I'd ask your accountant which countries does Canada allow you to withdraw these savings when you move there. Years ago (when I moved abroad in 2006), you could have moved to Ireland and simply withdraw all your RSPs/RIFs into a simple savings bank account in Ireland as a lump sum, while just paying a 10% withholding tax in Canada (which of course saves you a ton in taxes over your retirement years). This is no longer an option, but there might be other nations you can move to that Canada will allow you to do this with. And once you have your cash in a bank account, you won't ever have to pay tax on that money again. And you can invest in whatever you want without issues like you would if you had kept that money in your RSP.",45

I shudder whenever I think about how much money I spent on cars in the last two decades. Now, living in Toronto where public transit is significantly more developed, my transportation costs are essentially negligible - a full order of magnitude less than when I owned even a paid off compact car.

UCCpXy4y4McbV9Aege_yPASg,39600,4776282,175,2,Gecsu62oPpQ,This TFSA Trick Can Unlock Big GIS Money (Until the CRA Bans It!),16916,"Its normal TFSA isn't counted as income since it WAS counted as income when you first earned the money.
Its normal you're not taxed on it since you WERE already taxed on it at first.
Its just the opposite of RRSP which tax you later. TFSA you pay up front with the benefit that it will be more favorable in the future.
The gov won't do anything about it and the reason is very simple.
Right now you can invest into an RRSP to lower your income tax. This manouver can make you eligible for low income benefits since your taxable income for the year goes under a treshhold.
TFSA is the same thing, except in reverse. Since you didn't get access to the extra low income benefits during the years you invested, its normal that you get this benefit later.
In gaming language, its just a different playstyle which provide the same benefits, but differently/at a different point in life.

Examples you earn 60k a year :
RRSP : if you put 20k per year (not that this doesn't work forever since there is a cap, so its only ''good'' if you didn't save while yonger), then your taxable income becomes 40k
At 40k you become a low income person and benefit from about 2k extra non taxable $ from gov programs.
This means that you basically have the effective income of about 43-44k in addition to your 20k RRSP. You also get tax back from the 20k since you paid too much through payroll. Around 7k extra (net). This mean that even tho you saved 20k in RRSP, at the end of the day, you still had about 54-55k gross income to live with. Your RRSP was basically 75% off compared to someone who made 60k but didn't put any money in the RRSP.

TFSA : if you put 20k in your TFSA (also doesn't work forever, but I just make big numbers so its easier to explain the impact), your taxable income remains 60k.
You do not qualify for any low income person program and you pay taxes on the whole 60k EVEN THOUGH you didn't have 60k to live with.
Also your TFSA turning from 50k or 100k into millions of $$ in entirely speculative as it COULD also plummet to 0$. Of course we only talk about the 3 people with insane luck.
Regardless, you took the financial hit early on, paying more tax than anyone who made a salary of 40k (you paid taxes on the extra 20k of income).
And this is extremely difficult. The money you put in the TFSA is NET, which mean that for the purpose of this video, in order to put 20k NET in the TFSA, you had to live with about 60% of your income. The lifestyle between 100% income and 60% income is HUGE, considering flat fees like rent, grocery and etc can only get so low.

And that kind of sacrifice definitely deserves being able to have an amazing retirement IMO.",18

Financial success at retirement, absent some life-changing windfall, is the product of a large number of good choices, big and small, over a lifetime.  And choices are often driven by factors that are not really financial at all: whether a person takes the long view or lives for the moment, their financial literacy, sees value in life as defined by simple pleasures and not merely owning things, is able to distinguish between wants and needs, and other such matters of personality and self-awareness. 

To borrow a line from Joseph Campbell, it's the financial equivalent of the hero's journey.

That's not to say that life doesn't impose certain constraints, be it our income, our job, operating costs to maintain existence, and unexpected financial setbacks like job loss, illness, or divorce. But for many, there is a certain amount of room between our income and our overhead, and it's how we behave in that space -- notably around savings rate, investing, time in the market, and being disciplined about spending -- that decides whether we are a ""Ben"" or a ""Jerry."" 

Here's to all of us being a little more like Jerry!",4

What truly matters is not the absolute value of your savings, but whether those savings are aligned with the life you lead and the expenses you incur. Whether one has $1,000 or $1 million set aside is immaterial if their spending outpaces their income or reserves. Financial security is not a function of how much you have—it is a function of how wisely and sustainably you manage what you have.

On a side note, if you want a wake up call, visit one or two retirement homes in your area and inquire about the cost per month.  Even the “cheapest” option is often well over $5,000 a month- getting older is expensive and knowing this earlier, rather than later may help motivate you to spend less, save more now.",10

The steady-savings years were during the Harper era; notwithstanding the GFC in 2008 people were still able to save. And to be clear: that strong economy was built on the momentum from the Chrétien/Martin years, lest anyone think this is a partisan dig. We had over 20 years of sane, prudent, boring fiscal management in Canada under both Liberal and Conservative governments and we were much the better for it. 

Then, although you're too polite to make the explicit correlation, in 2015 came Mr. Trudeau, with first Mr. Morneau and then Ms. Freeland as Finance ministers. Canada abandoned prudent and boring budgets in favour of high-deficit spending, even if we ignore the Covid years as exceptional.

People complaining about about not being able to save in today's economy is a convenient excuse which I also heard from friends/family in the late 90's-early to mid 2000's.  They had the money for new vehicles every 3 to 5 years, and expensive vacations because, you know...YOLO.  They would say, ""Next year, for sure, next year I'm going to start saving/investing every month"".  Yet, the following year some random 'emergency' would appear so they'd push off their savings goal for another year.  Rinse and Repeat.

You're trading tax-free TFSA growth and income for tax-deferred RRSP growth (which will be fully taxable later). A small, temporary tax refund. You're giving up TFSA's lifetime tax-free compounding. You'll pay more tax later when withdrawing RRSP. Better to keep TFSA fully invested. TFSA to RRSP is just moving money in circles, and reduces long-term tax efficiency. In fact, pay the taxes now, and move your RRSP to your TFSA $7K each year.",1

About $600k is enough to be comfortable. Sounds overwhelming but assuming investments double every 10 years at 7% ROI that's the same as $75k at 35 years old without adding anymore,0

Anyone that just got in and borrowed the last possible dollar they could get probably shouldn’t have. It’s the same as  spending all your pocket money on lollies and not leaving enough money for the bus home and then blaming your decision to squeeze things too tight on someone else. It’s just unfortunate that people are learning this lesson on a house instead of something small like lollies.

We have eaten into our savings just to keep up and give me more time with my last bubs. The timing is terrible and I need to go back to work early just to keep up. So many people in different situations, but it has been good to see the interest increase on my children's savings accounts too. Pros and cons to everything.",1

I REALLY like the Flamingo approach of hitting 50% and then backing off and not caring about rushing the finish line as much.  Best strategy in my opinion.

While watching your incredible video's over the last year, I always had in the back of my mind that your approach was quite aggressive and that there would be a cost to it.  Obviously I stayed quiet as it is none of my business how people approach their financial plans.  But this video has pretty much confirmed what I thought, and I totally agree with your new thoughts.  

I'm having to be aggressive on my end due to mismanagement of my previous working life.  I'm far behind where you are at and am slightly older at 42.  So, I just have to buckle down.  But once I get to a certain stage, I'm taking my foot off the peddle - we need to enjoy our lives while we are young enough to do all the things we want to do.  Lived experiences is worth more than all the money in the world.

Case in point.  My Aunt (mums sister) visits from Scotland every couple of years; I take a break from my finances to provide both of them with travel experiences in Australia.  It sets me back a wee bit financially, but to build those experiences with important people that won't be around one day is so important to me.  And also to build experiences and memories for family that are younger - my nieces for instance - so when I'm gone one day, they will be able to reflect back with a smile (I hope).

It's a balancing act in the end.  I really hope that this new direction for you does improve your personal happiness.  From one over-thinker to another over-thinker... Good luck!",4

My Net Worth has dropped about $20,000.  But it's all on paper, nothing is realised.  I see it as an opportunity to put money into my ETF's at a cheaper price.  I think that's the way we have to look at things.  The only people that really hurt are those that need the money today and have to sell at a lower price = potentially at a loss.

Glad to see your house valuation doing so well.  What do you think about the future though - a lot of doomsayers saying a large housing correction is on the way, do you think this will happen?  I think again, it doesn't truly matter in your situation as it is your family home - again it's worth is mostly just a paper figure that means little until you need to sell.  Obviously can help when it comes to negotiating better deals with the banks, but it looks like you are already across that. 

(My crystal ball) I think the stock markets will rebound leading up to the end of 2023, not as dramatic as during COVID, but still quite strong.  And I do think their will be a correction in the housing market, too many over-leveraged people not prepared for interest rate rises and the house prices went up far too much in such a short space of time for this to be sustainable.  But we shall see - I just hope it is a soft landing for most Aussies no matter what happens.",4

- Keep putting $1200 per fortnight into my partners trading account.  She can't work, so we have it under her name for tax minimisation purposes.
- Do not purchase any shares (ETFs) until we have got confirmation that the bear market has stopped. 
- Be a fantastic tenant to our landlord to keep our rent well below the market - he has just raised it by $50 per week, but it's still good value.  $400/week in Gympie for a 4x2.
- Hope that the increasing interest rates bring down that inflated property bubble over the next 24 - 36 months.  Will be looking for a bargain. 
- Sell 2/3s of our ETFs when the time is right to purchase a property. 

There is a bit of speculation in there, but as long as we are flexible I reckon we can get a win.  
I have mixed feelings about those people that borrowed to the hilt at inflated house prices and are now going to really struggle to keep their heads above water.  This is where financial education has let so many down.  But I'll be angry if they get too much support from the government, which in turn keeps the bubble inflated and punishes those that are diligently saving and living within their means to get into property.  

The previous Federal Government, the banks and the RBA have a lot to answer for.  In my opinion.",3

One of the big things alot of finance enthusiasts push is the delayed gratification at an early age. Spending a decade in your 20's saving money and putting it away works incredibly well as the two largest contributing factors to compound interest is 1. How much are you starting with? (presumably large if you're spending a decade saving religiously) and 2. How long have you got (again presuming at 30 years old you still have another 30 years before needing the money for retirement).,3

Compound Interest & Charlie Munger,31703,"I think another part that makes that first $100k the hardest (at least for myself personally) was that it needed to be divided into certain foundation accounts - an emergency fund for instance of $20k.  These funds couldn't be invested into riskier places like the stock market as it needed to be stable and quickly accessible if needed.

Therefore that first lot of money was slowed down greatly from decent compounding which dragged out the process a bit.

However, it needed to be done to ensure I bulletproofed my life.",10

Also got me thinking about my $160/m Optus… first time since the iPhone was released have I not taken up the recontracting offer for a new iPhone every 2 years and will stick with a $30/m sim only plan for the foreseeable future.

One expense we magically cut was childcare. Our son was going to Montessori in Sydney 3 days a week and even after the subsidy it was costing $800/m. Then we found out that Penrith Council offers 4 free days split across 2 different centers so we’ve cut that from the budget too. Best thing is he actually preferred the free schools a lot more!

I just save up some splurge money to get dumbbells or other equipment periodically.  I've got one adjustable bench, and dumbbells ranging from 1kg to 20kg that I've collected over the last year - it doesn't use up much space at all.  Living up in Gympie, I get a good cardio workout just by power walking the hilly roads from where I live - to the Mary River and back - giving me 15,000 steps with fresh air and some beautiful scenery.  Also rubber bands - they are an amazing light weight / portable solution if you are away from home.

Push ups - free, jumping jacks - free, running on the spot - free, ab crunches - free, lunges/squats - free....... I think I've made my point.  The gym in my opinion is a luxury, not a necessity. But again, I understand for some people it may be part of their identity - and all power to them.",1

I do tend to think that one should try to sacrifice some of their 20's as this is prime year for compounding interest, but definitely if done correctly, take your foot off the gas in your 30's and actually enjoy life. If you've done the hard yards, with minimal discipline you should be able to have enough in your retirement account due to the power of compound interest.

100% agree about giving money away to your children. I don't have children yet (am currently in my late 20's) but I sure as hell could use extra money or gifts now to help put away more money and reach the ""early peak"" to ensure that compounding can take me the rest of the way. Don't get me wrong, a gift is a lovely gesture by money in your late 30's is likely somewhat useless unless you're still scrambling to get your retirement account sorted.",1

Basically, he skips over the step of calculating how much money you need to live the rest of your life, and that is multiply your living costs x years ahead. So if you need 50.000 a year and you are going to live 10 years, you need 500.000. But because the money is growing in investments, you don't need to have the whole amount up front, so he ran some numbers and came up with the idea that you only need about 70% of that number up front. The money will grow up to the need as you go. Thus you multiply the target by 0.7",0

Personally I prefer just seeing the number grow and grow quickly so I have to have quite a high savings rate or I lose interest. Nevertheless, could be an alternative to put things in perspective as chasing numbers usually ends up with you achieving a goal and simply moving to the next one while freedom days kind of ""cap out"" once you have the whole year free and essentially means you may not necessarily be able to use this calculator moving forward, prompting a decision by the user of whether it is time to use those freedom days or continue in the rat race that chasing numbers encourages.",0

I’m looking forward to more videos on each topic—they are easy to understand and enjoyable. I have a doubt. In the previous syllabus, for Paper 1 ERQ, students would prepare for the approach they were interested in, such as Biological, with only two studies, while for the rest—i.e., Sociocultural and Cognitive—they would prepare only one study for the sake of SAQs. Similarly, for Paper 2, SL students could choose Human Relationships and focus only on the Social Responsibility topic for the exam. In the new syllabus, are there any choices for students to select specific topics like in the previous syllabus, making it easier to study? Please guide me. Thank you so much.",1

In my opinion - once the syllabus changes have been announced (every 7 years or so) there should be NO changes in between those times. We shouldn't have to be constantly checking to see if topics, questions or IA criteria have changed within that time period.

Also a question - if a student replicates a study on anchoring bias - are you saying they can't use anchoring bias as their theory? What model would they use to describe this? Mine would usually talk about the Dual Process Model, then link it to biases and refer to anchoring bias as an example. Would this still be ok or not?! If not, I'm not sure where to go with this - and I have a group that has done this for the 2022 exam session! :(",3

It was very helpful. There's different variations of it, you'll see on Google - a couple of things that might need adding are ""Age"" to bio and ""Cultural background"" to social.

Because let me just say in my life and work, those two aspects are definitely factors for everybody and it's interesting but also dangerous when things go awry.

And no it's not ""ageism"" to list that as a factor. Age always has a bearing on things and a context to well being of course - whether we like it or not.

And cultural background also presents challenges particularly if for example like in some my life history, you perhaps spend a little too much time with friends who aren't really ""friends"" from a different cultural background.

UCyDymklPNMrOXKc3BG1dtBQ,14100,1605968,149,2,lcJfsOnsW0E,IB TOK EXPLAINED Ep 3: Why you cannot say that “human sciences are subjective”,5355,"A very good presentation and worthy attempt to resolve the problem of ""the social sciences"". However at times you seem to use the word ""study"" as if it can be conflated with the word ""science"". Of course it cannot. Study is necessary to science, but science is not necessary to study. Take, for example, an artist's study. ""Human sciences"" would more accurately be described as ""human studies"", if for no other reason than the fact that the studies themselves can grossly affect what is being studied (and yes I have heard of Schroedinger's Cat, but that is not a gross effect). For example, any so-called ""scientific theory"" of economics, once widely understood by economists, will affect the way the economy behaves on a macro level. Why? Because economists will implement the theory to ""run"" (i.e. affect) economies. As a result, yet another theory of economics will need to be created to encompass how these interactions between human theories and economies is affecting the outcome of what is being studied. You see the problem? This is a recursive process, where social ""scientists"" end up studying their own backsides. One can scientifically study human behaviour, of course, but trying to construct a scientific theory behind the reasons behind that behaviour, i.e.trying to apply science to subjective human experience, necessarily requires unsubstantiated and unverifiable storytelling that can itself affect how the subject behaves. 

The above does not hold for scientific theories, for example ""what happens inside a black hole"". They cannot affect the way a black hole behaves. The other difference here is a scientific theory will allow very accurate predictions based on that theory (for example the curvature of light around the sun) where accurate measurements can potentially support or completely falsify the theory. If a theory of human behaviour is not falsifiable, then it is not a scientific theory.

Or to put it another way, dreams are nature's way of telling us not everything in human experience has to make rational sense.",0

However, it’s important to note that many British people find being on benefits more appealing than low-wage jobs because the benefit payments can sometimes be slightly higher than what they would earn in such jobs. Meanwhile, immigrants who come here for work often end up in low-skilled, low-paid roles due to limited opportunities. Additionally, the UK invests more in foreign students who pay higher tuition fees, often at the expense of British students. This cycle results in fewer opportunities for British students and lower wages.

I'm looking to grow a startup business and short on monthly expendable income at the moment. For a few years I have put money in the snp500 and got a few thousand compounding. 
As it is still early, do you think it would be a suitable risk to invest this money into the business. It could help the business alot but also leave me with very little backup money or a compounding investment for retirement.

For context I am 25 around a slightly below average uk salary and have monthly expenses related to mortgage and upkeep of flat with a young child. 

Any help would be appreciated thank you :)",1

Then you mention production.  Production is Points on the board am I not right?  You want him to have 300 yards and the win right?
Didnt you mention on averaged starting their drive in the second half at the 41?  If you want him to produce massive yards then that means sont run on any of those drives.  Price price much had him in the redzone off a kick retuen.  Why scream and criticize over yards production if the situation doesnt call of it? 
You guys also said he wasnt ready, and looks like he's not ready for the NFL.  But he can go in and run an offense, and lead it to Victory against arguably the best tram in the league? Make it make sense",0

Buffalo is still trying to create an identity and all the injuries plaguing this team is hampering that.

It might be a close game. Both defenses are very good, so it may be a low scoring affair.  

Houston is tops in the league in limiting points versus their opponents.  They're top ranked overall through week 8.  Denver is also highly ranked and they.lead the league in sacks by a good margin.

It may come down to who makes fewer mistakes.  

I'm hoping for a Denver Broncos win, personally, but I'm very aware that it may not go that way.

The broncos offense needs to show up, but really, it's easy to pad your defensive stats against bad or injured teams, Texans have only beaten bad/mid, or last week incredibly injured teams, and they've played a lot of incomplete and bad teams. End of the day, if your offense can't stay on the field, it doesn't matter how good your defense is, especially when you're playing highly physical and dominant O line in the trenches. Our o line is one of the best, we have one of the best rushing attacks in the league, and we have the hardest to sack, accurate QB who protects the ball and has legs to boot. Funny how people think this will be a tough win. The Texans have a tall task if they want to compete, and TBH, Stroud and the offense HAVE to play better than the broncos offense if they wanna win, and in the stats that matter, like 3rd down and red zone, the broncos are way better. If the Texans defense get stuck on the field (which they'll need a season best performance that the Cowboys, Colts, and red hot healthy chargers couldn't pull off) then they'll be out there way too long. BAD matchup, broncos BTA on sunday",6

(Even the stats don't count!) 2nd the group stage is terrible, starting 5 games into the season and stretched out over 5 weeks. It's not even a tournament, just a bunch of random games. The best teams over that stretch can lose the wrong night and not advance. No one's ever going to care much about 8 teams advancing from having won a few random games to a playoff many don't care about advancing in.

Start it 35 or so games into the season and make it a real tournament with consecutive games so the best teams advance so you'll have the champion of the 1st half of the season, count the whole thing toward the regular season, and replace the all-star game with the 1st half championship and you might have something.",0

The Magic played the same dumb way. Every time Mosley's primary playmaker got injured, he handed it to the next guy and told them to keep doing the same thing. I'm not saying Paolo's secretly Halliburton, but I don't understand why anyone's blaming him for anything, he's a young guy playing for a coach who (I believe) WANTS to play a simple, dumb, predictable offense that he doesn't have to think about. There are plenty of coaches like this across sports, like Pete Carroll and Thibodeau ..... but Thibodeau was just a bit better at it and cared about a few specific things like shot selection. I'm not sure Mosley wants to think about it at all. He doesn't look at the Pacers and Heat and goes ""Wow that's interesting""! He thinks ""look at these losers running around like this is tag"".",0

 There's so much drumming up and money in college football it's got programs going crazy LSU wasn't the first and won't be the last..
 I like some points the governor made but he could have manipulated and done all that in private water until all the dust settles and hires are here and then come out and make his statements.
  Sure Scott giving BK bonuses for going 6-6 is wtf 
 Going forward the president set is that the next AD at LSU better treat the football program as if he's the GM.
 I tell you one thing that can cool the fire stick to hiring guys who you believe in and not who you invest in.
  Saban, Miles, Orgeron none of them had a name before coaching at LSU after they proved themself they then were paid. Contract has to and should be incentive base don't go with this narrative that if you don't put a guarantee 100 million on the table for your next coach that you wont be competing that's b.s. that is exactly how the BK contract was structured and look at what it got you.
Guys like Kelvin Sheldon, & Jeff Brohm are guys you can bring in under 30 million and with incentives their pay can increase.. you have to be able to make it affordable to cut your bait after 3 or 4 years if things don't go rite That keeps a good AD on board.

It is already apparent that his pitching is on an elite level with the best in baseball. This was not a one-off as he had already demolished a Yankee lineup with some very good hitters in the ALDS, going 5 no-hit innings with 11 strikeouts - and the reason he went all the way from pitching in A-ball to starting in the World Series in one season is because he simply refused to stop striking out everybody in the minor leagues - he would strike out the hitters, then he would strike out the opposing manager and coaching staff, then the umpires and some of the families that had come to watch the game.

But this season something is off and I, for one, am very concerned about this match.
If we can't nullify Spurs' strengths: set pieces; long throw-ins; crosses and their physicality, we'll be in big 💩especially if they decide to deploy the deepest low block we've ever seen 😂which is well within Thomas' wheelhouse.

And yet, his called his Dad after the shooting with concern. Which is it Gavin? He also stated that he did not get a lot of downloads from that podcast. I watched it on YouTube where it had well over a million views. And that's just one platform. He mentions that during his interview with Kirk, he saw that they had,  ""vehemently different views, like daylight and darkness"", yet in their conversation, Newsom agreed and related to some of Kirk's views, which Kirk admitted surprised him.

states that all men are created 
equal and endowed with unalienable rights. Including life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It declares that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and that the people have the right to alter or abolish a destructive government.
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

“You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor was excellent, stood before you; and its form was awesome. 32This image’s head was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 34You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. 35Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
36“This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. 37You, O king, are a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; 38and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all—you are this head of gold. 39But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. 40And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, that kingdom will break in pieces and crush all the others. 41Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. 42And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. 43As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. 44And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. 45Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold—the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.”",0

Like meat, recently I went to the store and there were many meat items for a reduced price. I bought them all and asked what the store would do with this if nobody else would buy it. ""we throw it in the trash!"" I asked if they could give it to the food bank but the cashier said they aren't allowed to give away meat, only other items are allowed. I payed around 100€ and got a big pile of different types of meat. By the way I was the last costumer who left the store before they close. I felt very happy with my purchase but it  gave me a goosebumps skin by thinking that all the stuff I just bought would be in the trash few minutes later. I mean the animal is killed only for being thrown in the trash? No I don't want that. And yes some stuff I don't like to buy. I can't understand why the store sell this stuff when it's often going in the trash. Mostly vegan items or something weird.😂",3

Sure they share similar electronic mediums but the participation requirement for gaming is closer to that of a sport. Watch a video of any length is like a fan of a sport in the bleachers. Playing a video game is like a player on the field of that sport. A player doesn’t just leave the field to get food whenever they want like a fan can because active engagement doesn’t allow for that, if you want to be proficient or at least effective.
